11 This case concerns a piece of
12 statutory text from 1974 in Section 2503, which
13 is found in the blue brief appendix at page 2a.
14 That provision exempts from the common law a
15 narrow set of instruments: a money order,
16 traveler's check, or other similar written
17 instrument other than a third-party bank check.
18 The question today is whether two
19 products, MoneyGram agent checks and MoneyGram
20 teller's checks, fall within that exemption.
21 For many years, the defendant states answered
22 that question "no." However, after engaging
23 some creative consultants, they changed their
24 mind.
25 They were right the first time for
Heritage Reporting CorporationOfficial
5
1 four separate reasons. First, when Congress
2 adopted that language in 1974, the term "money
3 order" referred to specific commercial products
4 labeled "money order" and typically sold to
5 unbanked consumers to pay small debts. Neither
6 of those apply to the two disputed instruments
7 here. They're not labeled "money order," and
8 they are sold to consumers with bank accounts
9 who are transferring larger sums of money.
10 Second, the FDA was a surgical fix to
11 this Court's 1972 decision with a key purpose
12 behind it, to prevent the price of small-dollar
13 instruments from increasing drew to -- due to
14 address collection requirements that states
15 might adopt in reaction to this Court's 1972
16 decision. That rationale does not apply here,
17 and the two instruments are outside of the FDA
18 altogether.
19 Third, even if you thought these
20 products were within the FDA, the two
21 instruments here fall within the third-party
22 bank check exception. Like all bank checks,
23 they are signed by bank employees, not
24 purchasers.
25 And, fourth, while we believe that our
Heritage Reporting CorporationOfficial
6
1 reading is the best reading of the FDA's text,
2 structure, and purpose, we don't deny one could
3 read the statute differently, but importantly,
4 if you found things in equipoise, two things
5 would independently break any tie for us.
6 One is the doctrine of reading
7 statutes to avoid derogation of the common law,
8 and the other is this Court's repeated emphasis
9 on the need for bright-line rules and
10 predictability in this space.
11 The defendants' interpretation would
12 upend all that, as their own amici acknowledge.
13 Our view of the statute, by contrast, is
14 predictable, reflects longstanding practice, and
15 provides a bright line for the escheatment of
16 financial products in the future.
17 JUSTICE THOMAS: Mr. Katyal, how much
18 weight do you put on this money order
19 designation? What if, tomorrow morning, they
20 simply stamp the top of these, the two disputed
21 instruments, "money order," "commercial money
22 order"? Would that solve your problem?
23 MR. KATYAL: So, Justice Thomas, that
24 -- if they changed the label, we do think that
25 it would mean it's not a money order or
Heritage Reporting CorporationOfficial
7
1 traveler's check. So we do think you look to
2 the label for that. And, indeed, I think that's
3 what they say about traveler's checks. But we
4 don't think it would be true for other similar
5 instruments.
6 So we think that in your hypothetical,
7 in which you have the exact same instrument, but
8 it has just a different name on it, that is an
9 other similar written instrument.
10 Notably, you know, that's never
11 happened, and the reason is because money orders
12 and those labels are important for consumers and
13 for banks. They want to know what they're
14 getting. They want to know what they're
15 selling. And that's why they can't point to a
16 single example where that label has ever been
17 stripped off.
18 But I agree with you, Justice Thomas,
19 if that happened, that would fall within the
20 FDA, your hypothetical.
21 JUSTICE THOMAS: So -- well, the --
22 can you point to any reason in the past why this
23 would be -- this definition of "money order" is
24 so narrow? It would seem to me that with its --
25 over time, it's not necessarily, as you say it
Heritage Reporting CorporationOfficial
8
1 is, a discrete set of instruments.
2 MR. KATYAL: So we don't doubt,
3 Justice Thomas, that there is a way to define
4 "money order" as broadly as my friends on the
5 other side do.
6 If you do that, it blows up things
7 like cashier's checks, certified checks, all the
8 stuff that the American Bank Association is
9 warning you about and that Judge Leval couldn't
10 get around because he just said I'm not going to
11 define it, but --
12 JUSTICE THOMAS: One -- one final
13 question, and I'm sure my colleagues will have
14 more. But how do you get around "similar," the
15 -- the similarity language? It seems as though
16 all of these are drafts and that if you say,
17 "well, it's not a money order," it looks like a
18 money order in many other ways.
19 So why is -- is it -- does it not fall
20 into the similarity category?
21 MR. KATYAL: Yes, Justice Thomas. We
22 don't think it falls into the similar --
23 similarity category. We think that's for things
24 like what you were talking about before in your
25 first question to me, where the -- where the
Heritage Reporting CorporationOfficial
9
1 name isn't there and possibly some other things.
2 But, here, there are three things
3 about these disputed instruments which aren't
4 true about money orders.
5 First, you can only buy disputed
6 instrument -- instruments at a bank. Money
7 orders are sold typically at retailers, CVS,
8 Walmart, and the like.
9 Second, you will have a bank account
10 when you buy them.
11 And -- and, third, -- and the third
12 point is that the money order -- the -- that --
13 that money orders aren't signed by the bank, but
14 these two disputed instruments are.
15 Now I know that sounds formalistic.
16 Here's why that matters: Because Congress and
17 the FDA was worried about what this Court
18 invited states to do in 1972, which is impose
19 address collection requirements on money orders
20 and traveler's checks.
21 And what they said is these are
22 small-denomination instruments. If you do that,
23 it's going to increase the price of them. The
24 disputed instruments, because there is that bank
25 account and because you're going into the bank,
Heritage Reporting CorporationOfficial
10
1 that address information is already being
2 collected now.
3 So, if you're worried about my
4 friend's point about equity and the windfall to
5 a particular state with respect to these
6 disputed instruments, the states have the
7 easiest fix in the world, a fix they didn't have
8 in 1972, which is to say whenever you're one of
9 those banks dealing with MoneyGram, you just
10 have to transmit the address information that
11 you're already collecting.
12 JUSTICE JACKSON: But, counsel, you
13 suggest that Congress's concern was the
14 collection of address information. If that was
15 so, they certainly did a weird thing in terms of
16 the statute that they wrote.
17 I mean, the statute did not just say
18 collect the information, which would have solved
19 the problem directly. The statute seemed to
20 take into account the fact that there were going
21 to be circumstances in which that information
22 was not collected, and Congress appeared to be
23 trying to override the common law with respect
24 to what happened because it was really concerned
25 about inequitable escheatment.
Heritage Reporting CorporationOfficial
11
1 And so my question is, to what extent
2 do these disputed instruments present that
3 problem? Because, if we believe that that's
4 what Congress really cared about, then why would
5 they have crafted a statute that excluded
6 certain instruments that presented that same
7 problem?
8 MR. KATYAL: Yeah, Justice Jackson, we
9 don't think that that windfall concern, that
10 equity concern, applies to the two disputed
11 instruments. So Congress in '74 was worried
12 about address collection requirements. They
13 said we want to head that off because that's
14 going to increase the price of traveler's checks
15 and money orders. That's why they didn't write
16 the statute that you were saying, which is to
17 impose address requirements.
18 The findings in 2501 say no, we want
19 the reverse, because, if you -- if states start
20 doing that, it's going to increase the cost of
21 those instruments. And so that concern doesn't
22 apply to the two disputed instruments here
23 because the address information is already being
24 collected. And then, when you're concerned
25 about the equity that still exists with respect
Heritage Reporting CorporationOfficial
12
1 to these two disputed instruments, because
2 Delaware has them, not for all bank checks,
3 obviously, Bank of Americas of the world and
4 Citibanks are really the large escheators in
5 this space.
6 But, with respect to the two disputed
7 instruments, to the extent that states,
8 including my friend's states, if they're worried
9 about the equity, they have the simplest and
10 easiest fix in the world, which is to just
11 require that the information, when you go in and
12 buy a teller's check or an agent check is
13 issued, it just has to be transmitted to
14 MoneyGram.
15 And if that happens, Justice Jackson,
16 then you avoid this whole equity about state of
17 incorporation because then the primary rule of
18 the common law would apply, which is the
19 creditor's last address.
20 JUSTICE JACKSON: You can only do that
21 with respect to your own state, right? I mean,
22 every state would have to adopt that rule in
23 order to solve the problem. And Congress, it
24 appears, wanted to solve the problem in a
25 different way.
Heritage Reporting CorporationOfficial
13
1 MR. KATYAL: So -- certainly, Congress
2 could solve it nationally. And this Court in --
3 in Justice Thomas's opinion in Delaware invited
4 Congress to do that with respect to the
5 inequities and windfall that it said wasn't
6 enough to -- to justify this Court departing
7 from the common law.
8 And then you're absolutely right,
9 Justice, any state that is concerned about the
10 inequity can pass a law. And I think it's
11 probably a pretty easy law for them to pass
12 because, quite honestly, they're just getting
13 extra money. And so it's up to them.
14 What my friends are asking you to do
15 is to basically break from the common law -- and
16 because of their policy concern -- and that is
17 exactly what this Court has said every time,
18 most recently in the Delaware case, that you
19 don't do, and here is why it's so dangerous.
20 My friend pitches this as a case about
21 the secondary -- dueling secondary rules about
22 place of incorporation versus principal place of
23 business. That's what happens if you don't have
24 addresses. But, if you adopt his
25 interpretation, you're also blowing up the --
Heritage Reporting CorporationOfficial
14
1 the primary rule.
2 So the primary rule, there's a big
3 dispute between -- a big -- or a big gulf
4 between the FDA, this Act, which uses -- which
5 uses -- which uses the -- the -- it moves away
6 from the last creditor's address, which is the
7 rule of the common law.
8 And so --
9 JUSTICE JACKSON: And so -- and you're
10 not reading that to be Congress's attempt,
11 Congress's attempt to break from the common law?
12 You're suggesting that what we do here is going
13 to blow up the common law. But I had understood
14 that the statute itself was trying to set out a
15 different set of parameters than what existed in
16 the common law.
17 MR. KATYAL: Oh, absolutely. We don't
18 doubt that they did that with respect to
19 traveler's checks and money orders, but there's
20 no indication that they went beyond that. And
21 we think you should read that narrowly because
22 the entire reason they wanted to move away from
23 the common law with respect to these two
24 instruments is because of the inequity and the
25 addresses not being collected, which would
Heritage Reporting CorporationOfficial
15
1 increase the cost of those items.
2 Those don't apply. Those policy
3 rationales don't apply here. And, notably,
4 Justice Jackson, Congress in 1974 knew exactly
5 how to write the statute that you're asking for
6 to get rid of the common law for a broader set
7 of instruments.
8 If you look at our blue brief at page
9 31, it quotes the 1966 Model Act, Uniform Act
10 for the disposition of unclaimed property, and
11 that text is "any sum ... on which a banking or
12 financial organization or business association
13 is directly liable, including, by way of
14 illustration but not of limitation, CDs, drafts,
15 money orders, and traveler's checks."
16 Now the first part of that statute
17 that I just read to you is exactly the language
18 from 2503. Indeed, Judge Leval below said it
19 would be the most extreme coincidence that you'd
20 use all of the same language from 1966 and the
21 FDA.
22 But what isn't in there? Everything
23 about by illustration, by -- by the -- the -- by
24 way of illustration but not of limitation, the
25 enumeration of other financial products, like
Heritage Reporting CorporationOfficial
16
1 certificates of deposits and the like.
2 And so Congress is telling you here in
3 this statute we mean traveler's checks, we mean
4 money orders. And, Justice Thomas, absolutely,
5 we mean other similar written instruments. But
6 that can't be everything that is prepaid the way
7 my friends would have it --
8 JUSTICE ALITO: If someone purchases
9 an -- an agent check or a teller check, what
10 information about that purchaser does the bank
11 transmit to MoneyGram?
12 MR. KATYAL: None. That's what the
13 record says.
14 JUSTICE ALITO: Nothing?
15 MR. KATYAL: They collect the
16 information, but it's not transmitted. And so
17 the record like at -- at our appendix page 599
18 says the information is collected.
19 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, they have to
20 tell MoneyGram something.
21 MR. KATYAL: They tell -- they -- they
22 don't tell the -- the actual name, the name of
23 the payee or the address of the payee, the
24 relevant information here. And, Justice Alito,
25 your opinion in the Yee case talked about the
Heritage Reporting CorporationOfficial
17
1 concerns about escheatment and about people not
2 getting due process and the like.
3 And to the extent you're concerned
4 about that, our rule, the common law rule,
5 incentivizes precisely that state solution
6 because states will then say: Look, if you
7 want, MoneyGram, if you want to come into our
8 state, you've got to transmit that information
9 and close this informational hiccup. That's
10 what our sur-reply at pages 22 to 23 goes down
11 -- goes through.
12 So that means MoneyGram will now be
13 under a duty to go and find those people and
14 say: You know, here, there's this abandoned
15 check. And if they can't find them even with
16 the address, then the information all goes into
17 the state unclaimed database, and then you can
18 search by name and address.
19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. --
20 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, you make the --
21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry, go
22 ahead.
23 JUSTICE ALITO: You make the fair
24 point that the states could require the banks to
25 transmit this information to MoneyGram. But
Heritage Reporting CorporationOfficial
18
1 just out of curiosity, why doesn't MoneyGram ask
2 for this information? Would that cost a lot of
3 money?
4 MR. KATYAL: Right. The -- the -- the
5 record doesn't say. I suppose it probably does
6 cost a little bit of money. And MoneyGram's
7 indifferent to this whole question and the
8 American Bar -- the American Bank Association
9 brief at page 1 says that, look, that these
10 companies are generally indifferent to these
11 things.
12 So it's a very easy statutory fix
13 because states will get money that they
14 otherwise wouldn't get. And that wasn't
15 available in 1974. That's what makes this case
16 so different from the 1974 FDA, because there,
17 and Congress specifically, as I was saying to
18 Justice Jackson, in 2501 made a specific
19 finding, address information is not being
20 collected for traveler's checks, not being
21 collected for money orders, and if you impose
22 that requirement on those small-dollar
23 instruments, it's going to increase the cost.
24 These are, of course, large-dollar
25 instruments, and so the money is much larger.
Heritage Reporting CorporationOfficial
19
1 And so there's a much better -- you know, a much
2 better incentive, particularly for the reasons,
3 Justice Alito, you wrote about in Yee, to try
4 and collect and find the rightful owners of this
5 property.
6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How -- how
7 much -- what's the comparison in terms of total
8 value? I mean, I understand your point that the
9 traveler's checks, the money orders, small,
10 small amounts, the official checks, the agent
11 checks, and the teller checks not limited, but
12 how many of each are there? Where -- where is
13 -- where is all the money? Is it the money
14 orders and traveler's checks or the big bank
15 check -- checks?
16 MR. KATYAL: Yeah, Your Honor,
17 unfortunately, the record I don't believe gives
18 us any quantification of that. We do know that
19 in 1974 the typical money order was between $1
20 and $25. And there's other evidence about that.
21 And even up to today, MoneyGram, for example,
22 limits money or -- money orders to a thousand
23 dollars and the like.
24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yeah, but the
25 question there I guess is how many of them there
Heritage Reporting CorporationOfficial
20
1 are.
2 MR. KATYAL: Correct. And I -- we
3 don't have information about that. I think
4 Congress wasn't concerned as much with overall
5 dollars as they were with the small
6 denominations and the fact that address
7 requirements would impose a much bigger burden
8 compared to the benefit you'd get, whereas here,
9 you know, I think with -- for these things,
10 teller's checks existed in 1974. Bank checks
11 and, you know, agent checks existed just by a
12 different name in 1974.
13 Congress pointedly didn't enumerate
14 any of that in the statute. They used, to use
15 Justice Gorsuch's convoluted -- phrase from the
16 first argument, convoluted.
17 (Laughter.)
18 MR. KATYAL: Sorry, Justice. You --
19 you called -- you called Congress's action in
20 the last argument "convoluted." And I think
21 that's right here, that if -- if their argument
22 is right, Congress chose a really weird way of
23 going about it.
24 JUSTICE GORSUCH: All right. I was
25 sitting here quietly.
Heritage Reporting CorporationOfficial
21
1 (Laughter.)
2 JUSTICE GORSUCH: But now you've drawn
3 me out, Mr. Katyal.
4 Other similar instruments, the
5 language Justice Thomas -- I've got a question,
6 fine, I'll come up with one, all right. What
7 does it mean on your account?
8 And on page 44 of your brief, it says
9 that "Congress likely intended the term 'other
10 similar written instrument' to capture alternate
11 spellings of 'money order' and 'traveler's
12 check,' such as ... American Express 'Travelers
13 Cheque.'" Q-U-E.
14 Okay. Now I am familiar with various
15 spellings of "traveler's check." I am not
16 familiar with various spellings of "money
17 order." Help me out.
18 MR. KATYAL: Yes. So exactly -- one
19 category is exactly what Justice Thomas began
20 the argument with, which is a money order in
21 every way, shape, and form, except it doesn't
22 have the label on it. So our argument is not
23 limited, Justice Gorsuch, to different
24 spellings.
25 Same product without the label is what
Heritage Reporting CorporationOfficial
22
1 an other similar instrument is. That's one
2 category. Another category are things, I think
3 generic products, so just like a copy is called
4 a Xerox, I think Congress in 1974 was worried
5 that a traveler's check might be called an AMEX
6 or worried that a money order might be called a
7 Western Union. That's a second category.
8 And then a third category of other
9 similar instruments are some of the things that
10 have been bandied about in this litigation and
11 in the briefs. So there's something called an
12 agent check money order. There's something
13 called a personal money order. That's in our
14 appendix at page 381. There's something called
15 a bank money order. There's something --
16 JUSTICE GORSUCH: I take your point.
17 Okay. But does it underline another point that
18 may be problematic, and that is that labels
19 cannot control substance in our analysis here?
20 We -- can we agree on that?
21 MR. KATYAL: We do.
22 JUSTICE GORSUCH: Okay.
23 MR. KATYAL: And -- and so our point
24 is labels are very good at deciding traveler's
25 check, money order. And they're good not just
Heritage Reporting CorporationOfficial
23
1 for courts.
2 JUSTICE GORSUCH: Well, I guess I'm
3 wondering why -- why they're good for some
4 purposes but not others?
5 MR. KATYAL: Because I think it
6 reflects, Justice Gorsuch --
7 JUSTICE GORSUCH: I mean, you like --
8 you don't like labels when it comes to this
9 little -- this little exception here.
10 MR. KATYAL: Oh, it's not that we
11 don't like them, Justice --
12 JUSTICE GORSUCH: But -- well, but if
13 I -- if I might just finish, I mean, then -- and
14 then have at it, okay? But you -- you admit
15 that labels can control for some purposes, but
16 yet you do ask us to place quite a lot of weight
17 on "money order" versus "traveler's check"
18 otherwise. And -- and so I'm just -- I'm -- I'm
19 -- I'm stuck there. So help me out.
20 MR. KATYAL: Yeah. So we -- we think
21 the labels matter because they matter -- they're
22 not just for courts. They're, after all, for
23 banks and consumers. Banks have to figure out,
24 you know, what is this product and where do --
25 which state do we escheat it to? And labels are
Heritage Reporting CorporationOfficial
24
1 a really good way to do that, as opposed to some
2 convoluted eight-factor test where you've got to
3 have law professors testifying about experts,
4 about what -- whether something is a money order
5 or not.
6 So we think labels in general work,
7 but Congress was concerned about more than that.
8 And that's what I was saying to Justice Thomas.
9 And so that's what "other similar written
10 instrument" does. It's labels for the first
11 part but not for the second part.
12 And I think Congress in 1974 had
13 examples of statutes in which other products
14 were enumerated. So our brief cites, for
15 example, 26 U.S.C. 6311, which is a 1970 statute
16 which refers to "any certified, treasurer's, or
17 cashier's check ... or any money order," I think
18 demonstrating that Congress knew -- thought
19 money orders were distinct from these other
20 products.
21 If you adopt my friend's
22 interpretation, cashier's checks, certified
23 checks, all of those become money orders because
24 they are all instrupents -- instruments that
25 prepay money. And as the American Bar
Heritage Reporting CorporationOfficial
25
1 Association brief says, that's going to be a
2 disaster because millions and millions of
3 dollars, and there's a little -- at least
4 there's some hyperbole -- or not hyperbole.
5 There's -- there's some subjective
6 quantification of this in the ABA brief saying
7 that that is incredibly damaging and
8 destabilizing to the financial sector because
9 this has all been around and done a certain way
10 since 1974.
11 JUSTICE KAGAN: So I -- I guess I
12 didn't understand until argument that you're
13 saying that "money orders" is an only label
14 test, is that right? And then the "similar
15 instruments" is where the -- the characteristics
16 of money orders come in, is that right?
17 MR. KATYAL: Correct.
18 JUSTICE KAGAN: And then what are the
19 characteristics of money orders that you're
20 pointing to? Like, what -- what -- what -- what
21 does some other non-labeled instrument have to
22 comply with in order to be determined to be a
23 "similar instrument"?
24 MR. KATYAL: Well, I do think it would
25 be a transfer of information in which address
Heritage Reporting CorporationOfficial
26
1 information isn't being collected and a
2 small-denomination kind of instrument. And so,
3 here, there's a wide gulf, however you define
4 "similar," between the two disputed instruments
5 and -- and agent checks -- excuse me -- and
6 teller's checks -- traveler's checks and money
7 orders.
8 And the three things are, number one,
9 in order to get a disputed instrument, you've
10 got to go to a bank to get it. Second, you will
11 have a bank account when you do so. And, third,
12 it's got to be signed by a bank employee.
13 And that's a pretty important
14 distinction because, when something is signed by
15 a bank employee, it makes the bank liable for
16 the piece of paper, as opposed to money orders,
17 which are limited recourse documents and you
18 can't sue the issuer of a money order the way
19 you can the two disputed instruments.
20 So we think those are three hallmarks.
21 Does that solve the --
22 JUSTICE KAGAN: So, I mean, it feels
23 as though you're picking things that, you know,
24 as you should, that -- that -- that make you
25 succeed in the case. But I could pick three
Heritage Reporting CorporationOfficial
27
1 other things that make Arkansas succeed.
2 MR. KATYAL: We're -- we're not just
3 randomly picking these, Justice Kagan. It goes
4 to, I think, Justice Jackson's question to me
5 earlier, which is the purpose behind this, which
6 is the address information isn't being
7 collected. It's burdensome to do so. That's a
8 statutory finding. And the equity windfall
9 considerations.
10 Here, for these disputed instruments,
11 the states have the easy fix available to them
12 that wasn't available to them in 1974 because,
13 if states did what this Court invited them to do
14 in 1972 in response to the windfall concern, it
15 would increase the cost of those instruments and
16 be problematic. And so that's why Congress
17 said, uh-uh, we're heading it off for those
18 instruments but not for these.
19 And these factors that I'm referring
20 to you are relevant to that because they show
21 address information is being collected for the
22 disputed instruments, not being collected for
23 traveler's checks and money orders. That's the
24 key difference between the two.
25 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, the --
Heritage Reporting CorporationOfficial
28
1 MoneyGram treats one of its other official
2 checks, the agent check money orders, as subject
3 to the FDA. Justice Thomas asked you what
4 happens if they remove that tomorrow.
5 Under your test that you just
6 articulated to Justice Kagan, then it would go
7 back to not being a money order?
8 MR. KATYAL: No, Your Honor. If I
9 understand your question, it's the same
10 instrument. It just doesn't have the label
11 "money order" on it.
12 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: They take it off.
13 MR. KATYAL: Yeah. If they take it
14 off --
15 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It's issued by --
16 MR. KATYAL: -- that is an other --
17 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- it's issued by
18 a bank --
19 MR. KATYAL: Right.
20 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- not a retail
21 operator. They do collect information, don't
22 they?
23 MR. KATYAL: For agent check money
24 orders, I think some information is collected,
25 yes.
Heritage Reporting CorporationOfficial
29
1 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. And
2 what was your third criteria?
3 MR. KATYAL: That -- that you have to
4 have an account at the bank and --
5 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And they have an
6 account at the bank.
7 MR. KATYAL: -- and they may have an
8 account at the bank.
9 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So --
10 MR. KATYAL: So, with respect to that,
11 you know, limited universe, we do -- even there,
12 I guess I should say, let's look at that,
13 Justice Sotomayor. It's at page 230 and 231, is
14 an agent check money order.
15 And so what it says on the front is
16 that -- there's a picture of it, and it says on
17 the front that -- you know, that it's labeled
18 agent check money order. And then, on the back,
19 it says, if the instrument is designated on its
20 face as a money order, then the following
21 applies, and it says it's limited recourse.
22 Now, if you strike that off from the
23 back, then you might be -- then I think you are
24 fundamentally changing the nature of the
25 document because you're making it now not a
Heritage Reporting CorporationOfficial
30
1 limited recourse document; you're making it
2 something else.
3 And so that actually is a substantive
4 change. I think it's a -- and the reason --
5 that's why I'm going through this, because it's
6 different very much --
7 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's not the
8 example I gave.
9 MR. KATYAL: -- than Justice Thomas's
10 hypothetical. So our view on this is generally
11 labels will control. In some circumstances, if
12 you have the very same product, just not the
13 label, then that is an other similar instrument.
14 But, for your question, which is
15 actually changing the meaning of the document
16 itself, then that isn't one that is an other
17 similar written instrument.
18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,
19 counsel.
20 Justice Thomas, anything further?
21 JUSTICE THOMAS: No questions.
22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Justice Alito?
23 JUSTICE ALITO: You say that a
24 third-party bank check is a check that is
25 effective on the signature of a bank officer.
Heritage Reporting CorporationOfficial
31
1 But isn't it the bank's liability and not the
2 signature that makes an instrument a bank check?
3 The signature merely indicates that the bank is
4 liable?
5 MR. KATYAL: No, Your Honor, I think
6 the signature is the thing that does make the
7 bank check actually effective. And we point you
8 to Munn's, which we cite to in our brief, for
9 exactly that. And I think your question's
10 really important because Judge Leval said, well,
11 I'm going to look to the Hunt Commission to
12 determine what a third-party bank check is, and
13 a third-party bank check, he says, according to
14 the Hunt Commission, is a personal check.
15 But, actually, the Hunt Commission
16 says that's just one example. And, notably,
17 really importantly, at page 41 of our brief, we
18 say, if you go on and read what the Hunt
19 Commission says, it actually says teller's
20 checks are third-party bank payment systems.
21 So the Hunt Commission invocation
22 boomerangs on them. It underscores that the
23 types of disputed instruments here, these
24 teller's checks, are third-party bank checks.
25 Congress was worried about these larger-dollar
Heritage Reporting CorporationOfficial
32
1 products, like teller's checks, and they
2 specifically exempted them.
3 And so even if you didn't buy anything
4 that I've been saying for the last 25 minutes
5 about "we're not falling within the FDA at all,"
6 we would fall within the third-party bank
7 exception. We don't think you have to get
8 there, of course.
9 JUSTICE ALITO: Whether a bank
10 employee signs the check or not is a formality.
11 What -- what is the effect of that?
12 MR. KATYAL: We -- we think it's more
13 than a formality. We think that is actually the
14 relevant characteristic that Munn's, Wallach,
15 and Lawrence all say that makes something a bank
16 check, you look to that.
17 Now, admittedly, it's not the clearest
18 of phrases, but we think that's the one that
19 gives it some meaning and reflects Congress's
20 1974 knowledge. Teller's checks were around in
21 '74, and yet Congress didn't enumerate them in
22 2503, much more narrow statute than the 1966
23 one.
24 JUSTICE ALITO: Thank you.
25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Justice
Heritage Reporting CorporationOfficial
33
1 Sotomayor?
2 Justice Gorsuch?
3 JUSTICE GORSUCH: Thank you.
4 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH: Just to pick up
5 quickly on Justice Kagan's earlier question on
6 "similar written instrument," that's kind of a
7 statutory version -- version of ejusdem generis,
8 I suppose, and we're always trying to figure out
9 what the key features are.
10 Why aren't the key features here
11 prepaid money transmission product, doesn't show
12 last known address of purchaser, and the
13 windfall purpose is implicated? So you have
14 arguments, but why aren't those the better
15 features to focus on when we're figuring out
16 what "similar" means here?
17 MR. KATYAL: Be -- because, if you do
18 that, you blow up the statute to include
19 cashier's checks, certified checks, and all
20 sorts of stuff that Congress knew exactly how to
21 name or to write open-ended statutes and didn't.
22 And so, to us, you know, going back to
23 the statutory interpretation question, it's like
24 a statute that said, you know, rubber bands,
25 paper clips, or other similar items.
Heritage Reporting CorporationOfficial
34
1 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH: Mm-hmm.
2 MR. KATYAL: You know, so yes, could
3 you find some commonalities? Sure, but I don't
4 think it means other -- all office products,
5 like desk chairs or paper or things like that.
6 You're looking for something more
7 narrow. And as I said to Justice Jackson, the
8 statutory findings give you what Congress was
9 thinking about here in terms of address
10 collection and the burdens.
11 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH: Thank you.
12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Justice
13 Barrett?
14 JUSTICE BARRETT: No.
15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Justice
16 Jackson?
17 JUSTICE JACKSON: Yes, just one
18 question that is confusing me.
19 You keep suggesting that larger-dollar
20 products are exempted from the statute, things
21 that would be covered by -- like the disputed
22 instruments, they deal with larger dollar and
23 money order, smaller dollar.
24 What I don't understand is why that's
25 the case. I've heard you said -- say that there
Heritage Reporting CorporationOfficial
35
1 would be an incentive to include address
2 information for larger-dollar products, but if
3 that's true, then, under the common law, we
4 wouldn't have the inequitable escheatment
5 problem.
6 So the fact that the states are
7 fighting about these disputed instruments
8 indicates to me that the disputed instruments
9 don't have addresses on them, which undermines
10 your argument that larger-dollar products would
11 necessarily carry with them the address
12 information.
13 Do you understand what I'm saying?
14 MR. KATYAL: Absolutely, Justice
15 Jackson.
16 JUSTICE JACKSON: Yes.
17 MR. KATYAL: So the record is clear on
18 this, and I don't think my friends on --
19 disagree, that for the disputed instruments,
20 address and payee information is being found.
21 That's our appendix at page 599. It's the ABA
22 brief at page 22. Our appendix also at page 400
23 and quoting even from 1956 the ABA report.
24 The reason why it's being collected
25 has everything to do with money laundering
Heritage Reporting CorporationOfficial
36
1 requirements and the like. 31 C.F.R. 1010
2 requires collection of this information for
3 anything over $3,000.
4 The informational hiccup is the
5 information is being collected, it's just not
6 being transmitted to MoneyGram, and that's where
7 the states have a simple statutory fix. They're
8 asking you to do their hard work for them.
9 And if they did that statutory fix, it
10 would be prospective. It wouldn't jeopardize
11 everything that's happened since 1974 in which
12 state -- a state like Delaware has collected,
13 you know, money under a certain set of
14 escheatment rules and they want to unwind all of
15 that.
16 And that would be very destabilizing
17 not just for the products at issue here but
18 certified checks, cashier's checks, as the ABA
19 says.
20 JUSTICE JACKSON: Thank you.
21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,
22 counsel.
