JUSTICE ALITO:  If someone purchases
an -- an agent check or a teller check, what
information about that purchaser does the bank
transmit to MoneyGram?
MR. KATYAL: None.  That's what the
record says.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Nothing? MR. KATYAL: They collect the
information, but it's not transmitted.  And so the record like at -- at our appendix page 599
says the information is collected.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, they have to
tell MoneyGram something.
MR. KATYAL: They tell -- they -- they
don't tell the -- the actual name, the name of
the payee or the address of the payee, the
relevant information here.  And, Justice Alito, your opinion in the Yee case talked about the

concerns about escheatment and about people not getting due process and the like.
And to the extent you're concerned
about that, our rule, the common law rule,
incentivizes precisely that state solution because states will then say: Look, if you want, MoneyGram, if you want to come into our
state, you've got to transmit that information and close this informational hiccup.  That's
what our sur- reply at pages 22 to 23 goes down
-- goes through.
So that means MoneyGram will now be
under a duty to go and find those people and say: You know, here, there's this abandoned check. And if they can't find them even with the address, then the information all goes into the state unclaimed database, and then you can search by name and address.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, you make the --
JUSTICE ALITO:  You make the fair
point that the states could require the banks to transmit this information to MoneyGram.  But

just out of curiosity, why doesn't MoneyGram ask
for this information?  Would that cost a lot of money?
MR. KATYAL: Right.  The -- the -- the
record doesn't say.  I suppose it probably does cost a little bit of money.  And MoneyGram's
indifferent to this whole question and the
American Bar --the American Bank Association
brief at page 1 says that, look, that these
companies are generally indifferent to these things.
So it's a very easy statutory fix
because states will get money that they otherwise wouldn't get.  And that wasn't available in 1974.  That's what makes this case so different from the 1974 FDA, because there, and Congress specifically, as I was saying to Justice Jackson, in 2501 made a specific finding, address information is not being collected for traveler's checks, not being collected for money orders, and if you impose that requirement on those small- dollar
instruments, it's going to increase the cost.
These are, of course, large- dollar
instruments, and so the money is much larger.

And so there's a much better -- you know, a much
better incentive, particularly for the reasons, Justice Alito, you wrote about in Yee, to try and collect and find the rightful owners of this
property.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Whether a bank
employee signs the check or not is a formality. What --what is the effect of that?
MR. KATYAL:  We -- we think it's more
than a formality.  We think that is actually the relevant characteristic that Munn's, Wallach, and Lawrence all say that makes something a bank check, you look to that.
Now, admittedly, it's not the clearest
of phrases, but we think that's the one that gives it some meaning and reflects Congress's 1974 knowledge. Teller's checks were around in '74, and yet Congress didn't enumerate them in 2503, much more narrow statute than the 1966 one.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Thank you.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Can I mention a --a
number of different things and ask you to tell me whether you think they are subject to the FDA?
So the first one is a conventional
cashier's check or a teller's check issued by a local bank and used to pay its own obligations.
MR. BRONNI: I -- so I would say, it's
-- under our definition, it doesn't meet our definition of a money order.  We have not taken a position necessarily on whether it's a similar written instrument, but I -- I think that there are reasons for believing that it is not because, again, that is not an instrument that would present the windfall problem, as Your Honor framed it.
JUSTICE ALITO:  And what about a -- a

conventional cashier's check or teller's check issued by a local bank and sold to a bank
customer?  Same thing?
MR. BRONNI: Yeah, again, Your Honor,
they would typically keep addresses in -- in --
in 1974, certainly, for cashier's checks and classic teller's checks.
If I can briefly just add to that,
because we've talked about teller's checks a
lot, these instruments --I know I've said this,
but to make clear, these instruments are not traditional teller's checks.  They label them as teller's checks, but they do not operate like traditional teller's --
So a traditional teller's check as it
existed in the 1970s was an instrument, yes, signed by a --a bank officer.  They're right
about that part, and they stop reading, basically, at that point.  But the rest of the definition is a -- signed by a bank officer drawing on funds of his bank at a -- another financial institution.
The difference with these items is
that's not what's happening here.  The -- the
signing officer is not drawing on funds of his

own bank anywhere, which also indicates that
they --they don't even meet the definition of
"bank check."
JUSTICE ALITO:  How about a prepaid
cash card?  Some grandparents always used to send their grandchildren a MoneyGram -- a
MoneyGram for Christmas.  And now they want to become more modern, so they send them a prepaid Visa cash card.
MR. BRONNI: Not covered either as a
money order or a similar written instrument because it has to have a named payee, and gift cards do not have named payees.
JUSTICE ALITO:  How about a gift
certificate that does have a named payee?

MR. BRONNI: A -- a -- I -- I suppose
it's --it's possible if that instrument were a
draft. There's not really any record
development on this point, that -- that we could
quibble about that.  And I know that there are
some states that do cover instruments like --that have statutes that would cover escheatment
for instruments like that.
The reason why I'm struggling with
that one is I don't know all the characteristics of a gift certificate as opposed to a gift card.
