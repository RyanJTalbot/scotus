JUSTICE GORSUCH:  But now you've drawn
me out, Mr. Katy al.
Other similar instruments, the
language Justice Thomas -- I've got a question,
fine, I'll come up with one, all right.  What
does it mean on your account?
And on page 44 of your brief, it says
that "Congress likely intended the term 'other similar written instrument' to capture alternate spellings of 'money order' and 'traveler's check,' such as ... American Express 'Travelers Cheque.'"  Q-U- E.
Okay. Now I am familiar with various
spellings of "traveler's check." I am not familiar with various spellings of "money order."  Help me out.
MR. KATYAL: Yes.  So exactly -- one
category is exactly what Justice Thomas began the argument with, which is a money order in every way, shape, and form, except it doesn't have the label on it. So our argument is not limited, Justice Gorsuch, to different spellings.
Same product without the label is what

an other similar instrument is. That's one
category.  Another category are things, I think
generic products, so just like a copy is called a Xerox, I think Congress in 1974 was worried
that a traveler's check might be called an AMEX
or worried that a money order might be called a Western Union. That's a second category.
And then a third category of other
similar instruments are some of the things that have been bandied about in this litigation and in the briefs. So there's something called an agent check money order.  There's something called a personal money order.  That's in o ur
appendix at page 381. There's something called a bank money order.  There's something --
JUSTICE GORSUCH:  I take your point.
Okay. But does it underline another point that may be problematic, and that is that labels cannot control substance in our analysis here? We --can we agree on that?
MR. KATYAL: We do. JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Okay. MR. KATYAL: And -- and so our point
is labels are very good at deciding traveler's check, money order.  And they're good not just

for courts.
JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Well, I guess I'm
wondering why -- why they're good for some purposes b ut not others?
MR. KATYAL: Because I think it
reflects, Justice Gorsuch --
JUSTICE GORSUCH:  I mean, you like --
you don't like labels when it comes to this
little -- this little exception here.
MR. KATYAL: Oh, it's not that we
don't like them, Justice --
JUSTICE GORSUCH:  But --well, but if
I -- if I might just finish, I mean, then -- and
then have at it, okay? But you --you admit
that labels can control for some purposes, but yet you do ask us to place quite a lot of weight on "money order" versus "traveler's check" otherwise.  And -- and so I'm just -- I'm -- I'm
-- I'm stuck there. So help me out.
MR. KATYAL: Yeah.  So we -- we think
the labels matter because they matter --they're
not just for courts.  They're, after all, for banks and consumers.  Banks have to figure out, you know, what is this product and where do --which state do we escheat it to? And labels are

a really good way to do that, as opposed to some
convoluted eight -factor test where you've got to
have law professors testifying about experts,
about what -- whether something is a money order or not.
So we think labels in general work,
but Congress was concerned about more than that. And that's what I was saying to Justice Thomas.
And so that's what "other similar written
instrument" does. It's labels for the first part but not for the second part.
And I think Congress in 1974 had
examples of statutes in which other products were enumerated.  So our brief cites, for example, 26 U.S.C. 6311, which is a 1970 statute which refers to "any certified, treasurer's, or cashier's check ... or any money order," I think demonstrating that Congress knew -- thought money orders were distinct from these other products.
If you adopt my friend's
interpretation, cashier's checks, certified checks, all of those become money orders because they are all instrupents --instruments that
prepay money.  And as the American Bar

Association brief says, that's going to be a
disaster because millions and millions of
dollars, and there's a little -- at least
there's some hyperbole -- or not hyperbole.
There's -- there's some subjective
quantification of this in the ABA brief saying
that that is incredibly damaging and
destabilizing to the financial sector because this has all been around and done a certain way since 1974.
JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Can I ask you a
question that kind of goes sideways?  At --at
-- at places in your brief, you indicate that you're after not just a declaration of rights here under the Disposition Act, but you actually want money damages for past wrongful takings of monies you think belong to your states.
What --what is the -- what is the
cause of action that permits that?  Is that an implied cause of action under the Disposition Act? What -- I'm just curious, if -- if -- if
we were to agree with you, what happens next and on what theory?
MR. BRONNI: So I --I think it is an
implied cause of action under the statute, but I would add that we have not litigated the damages issue or the question, those kinds of arguments haven't been presented to Judge Leval because

the parties agreed to bifurcate the proceedings
here. So we haven't addressed any of the damages issues.
But, as for things -- I know Delaware
discusses in its brief, you know, the -- the
possibility that -- that it could need to repay this money.  But what I would -- I would highlight is, you know, anytime we're dealing
with unclaimed property, the -- the state is
essentially holding it in trust.
It's not the State of Delaware's
money. It's not -- not really our state's money. We hold it in trust for our -- for
the -- the -- the true owners. So requiring it
to pay that money to the appropriate state whic h
will hold it in trust for the actual owners, Delaware really doesn't have any reliance interest there that would be upset.
JUSTICE GORSUCH:  But whether there's
an -- such an implied cause of action under the
Disposition Act would be something that the Special Master would have to resolve after this?
MR. BRONNI: For the -- for the
damages issue --
JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Yeah.

MR. BRONNI: -- yes, Your Honor, I
think that's something that could be resolved in
there.
JUSTICE GORSUCH:  All right.  All
right. Thank you.  Thank you.
MR. BRONNI: There's one other point I
wanted to -- or a couple of points I wanted to briefly address.  I've -- I mentioned briefly
the bank check thing, but I want to make sure I -- I --I make this clear.
You know, Delaware's definition of a
third-party bank check, setting aside whether an
issuer or processor could be a third party in 1974, and it can't for the reasons the experts explain, but these instruments don't even meet Delaware's own definition of a bank check.  So Delaware says that in order to be a third- party
bank check, something must first be a bank check.
As I mentioned earlier when we were
discussing teller's checks, a -- a -- a bank
check -- and this is -- is really you've only
been offered two sort of reasonable readings of what that term meant in the 1970s or even today, one of which I'll call the sort of technical

definition.
This is at page 37 of their exceptions
where they say that a -- a bank check is an
instrument that's signed by a bank officer, and, as I said before, they stopped reading at that point, but it actually says drawing on funds deposited in the officer's own bank, that's a classic cashier's check, or drawing on funds of the officer's bank deposited in another financial institution.  That's a classic or traditional teller's check.
Again, that does not describe these
instruments here.  When the bank officer signs, one, he's signing as an agent of MoneyGram.  To the extent that's not already obvious as a functional matter, the contracts between MoneyGram and the financial institutions make very clear the financial institution is an agent of MoneyGram.
So in --it doesn't -- there -- these
instruments don't meet that definition because it's --it's not signing to draw on any funds
that are in any control of the selling bank.
Instead, it's MoneyGram that has the
money, and it's MoneyGram that is responsible

for paying the drawee bank or for reporting the
unclaimed property.
The other definition of bank check
that you've been given is a broader definition than that, and it's the -- the definition that Brady's Law of Bank Checks, which is again reproduced in Delaware's appendix, gives for bank checks where it describes a bank check as
both those -- that technical definition that I
just mentioned but also ordinary checks.
Or -- in -- in the 1970s going all the
way back until World War I, "bank check" had been used as a terminology -- used as a term under Brady's Law of Bank Checks to both mean those -- those specific instruments issued by banks but also ordinary checks, and that's part of why a third -party bank check ultimately, what
that phrase means if we're in the "similar written instrument" provision, is an ordinary check.
