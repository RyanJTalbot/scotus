JUSTICE JACKSON:  But, counsel, you
suggest that Congress's concern was the
collection of address information.  If that was so, they certainly did a weird thing in terms of the statute that they wrote.
I mean, the statute did not just say
collect the information, which would have solved the problem directly.  The statute seemed to take into account the fact that there were going to be circumstances in which that information was not collected, and Congress appeared to be trying to override the common law with respect to what happened because it was really concerned about inequitable escheatment.

And so my question is, to what extent
do these disputed instruments present that
problem?  Because, if we believe that that's what Congress really cared about, then why would they have crafted a statute that excluded
certain instruments that presented that same
problem?
MR. KATYAL: Yeah, Justice Jackson, we
don't think that that windfall concern, that
equity concern , applies to the two disputed
instruments.  So Congress in '74 was worried about address collection requirements.  They said we want to head that off because that's going to increase the price of traveler's checks and money orders.  That's why they didn't write the statute that you were saying, which is to impose address requirements.
The findings in 2501 say no, we want
the reverse, because, if you --if states start
doing that, it's going to increase the cost of those instruments.  And so that concern doesn't apply to the two disputed instruments here because the address information is already being collected.  And then, when you're concerned about the equity that still exists with respect

to these two disputed instruments, because Delaware has them, not for all bank checks,
obviously, Bank of Americas of the world and
Citibanks are really the large escheators in this space.
But, with respect to the two disputed
instruments, to the extent that states,
including my friend's states, if they're worried
about the equity, they have the simplest and easiest fix in the world, which is to just require that the information, when you go in and
buy a teller's check or an agent check is issued, it just has to be transmitted to MoneyGram.
And if that happens, Justice Jackson,
then you avoid this whole equity about state of incorporation because then the primary rule of the common law would apply, which is the creditor's last address.
JUSTICE JACKSON:  You can only do that
with respect to your own state, right?  I mean, every state would have to adopt that rule in order to solve the problem.  And Congress, it appears, wanted to solve the problem in a different way.

MR. KATYAL: So -- certainly, Congress
could solve it nationally.  And this Court in --
in Justice Thomas's opinion in Delaware invited Congress to do that with respect to the inequities and windfall that it said wasn't
enough to -- to justify this Court departing from the common law.
And then you're absolutely right,
Justice, any state that is concerned about the inequity can pass a law. And I think it's probably a pretty easy law for them to pass because, quite honestly, they're just getting extra money.  And so it's up to them.
What my friends are asking you to do
is to basically break from the common law -- and
because of their policy concern --and that is
exactly what this Court has said every time, most recently in the Delaware case, that you don't do, and here is why it's so dangerous.
My friend pitches this as a case about
the secondary -- dueling secondary rules about place of incorporation versus principal place of business.  That's what happens if you don't have addresses.  But, if you adopt his interpretation, you're also blowing up the --

the primary rule.
So the primary rule, there's a big
dispute between -- a big -- or a big gulf
between the FDA, this Act, which uses --which
uses --which uses the -- the -- it moves away
from the last creditor's address, which is the rule of the common law.
And so --
JUSTICE JACKSON:  And so -- and you're
not reading that to be Congress's attempt, Congress's attempt to break from the common law? You're suggesting that what we do here is going to blow up the common law.  But I had understood that the statute itself was trying to set out a different set of parameters than what existed in the common law.
MR. KATYAL: Oh, absolutely.  We don't
doubt that they did that with respect to traveler's checks and money orders, but there's no indication that they went beyond that.  And we think you should read that narrowly because the entire reason they wanted to move away from the common law with respect to these two instruments is because of the inequity and the addresses not being collected, which would

increase the cost of those items.
Those don't apply.  Those policy
rationales don't apply here.  And, notably, Justice Jackson, Congress in 1974 knew exactly
how to write the statute that you're asking for to get rid of the common law for a broader set
of instruments.
If you look at our blue brief at page
31, it quotes the 1966 Model Act, Uniform Act
for the disposition of unclaimed property, and that text is "any sum ... on which a banking or financial organization or business association is directly liable, including, by way of illustration but not of limitation, CDs, drafts, money orders, and traveler's checks."
Now the first part of that statute
that I just read to you is exactly the language from 2503.  Indeed, Judge Leval below said it would be the most extreme coincidence that you'd use all of the same language from 1966 and the FDA.
But what isn't in there?  Everything
about by illustration, by -- by the -- the -- by
way of illustration but not of limitation, the enumeration of other financial products, like

certificates of deposits and the like.
And so Congress is telling you he re in
this statute we mean traveler's checks, we mean
money orders.  And, Justice Thomas, absolutely, we mean other similar written instruments.  But that can't be everything that is prepaid the way my friends would have it --
JUSTICE JACKSON:  Yes, just one
question that is confusing me.
You keep suggesting that larger- dollar
products are exempted from the statute, things that would be covered by --like the disputed
instruments, they deal with larger dollar and money order, smaller dollar.
What I don't understand is why that's
the case.  I've heard you said -- say that there

would be an incentive to include address
information for larger -dollar products, but if
that's true, then, under the common law, we
wouldn't have the inequitable escheatment problem.
So the fact that the states are
fighting about these disputed instruments indicates to me that the disputed instruments don't have addresses on them, which undermines
your argument that larger- dollar products would
necessarily carry with them the address information.
Do you understand what I'm saying? MR. KATYAL: Absolutely, Justice
Jackson.
JUSTICE JACKSON:  Yes. MR. KATYAL: So the record is clear on
this, and I don't think my friends on --
disagree, that for the disputed instruments, address and payee information is being found. That's our appendix at page 599. It's the ABA brief at page 22.  Our appendix also at page 400 and quoting even from 1956 the ABA report.
The reason why it's being collected

requires collection of this information for
anything over $3,000.
The informational hiccup is the
information is being collected, it's just not
being transmitted to MoneyGram, and that's where the states have a simple statutory fix. They're
asking you to do their hard work for them.
And if they did that statutory fix, it
would be prospective.  It wouldn't jeopardize everything that's happened since 1974 in which state -- a state like Delaware has collected, you know, money under a certain set of escheatment rules and they want to unwind all of that.
And that would be very destabilizing
not just for the products at issue here but certified checks, cashier's checks, as the ABA says.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF NICHOLAS J. BRONNI
ON BEHALF OF ARKANSAS, ET AL.
MR. BRONNI: Mr. Chief Justice, and
may it please the Court:
This case presents the problem the FDA
was enacted to solve.  In Pennsylvania versus New York, this Court c oncluded that unclaimed
financial instruments escheat to a purchaser's state of residence or, if that's unknown, to an
issuer's state of incorporation.
Because issuers of certain financial
instruments rarely kept purchaser addresses, that meant a windfall for an issuer's state of incorporation at the expense of its fellow states.
Just two years later, Congress
responded to that inequity by enacting the FDA. That statute says that where addresses aren't typically kept for a class of instruments, those instruments escheat to the state of purchase.
Now, 50 years later, Delaware claims
that it's entitled to the exact same sort of windfall t hat led to the enactment of the FDA.
To justify that, it argues that the
FDA doesn't cover instruments that function

precisely like other money orders but are
marketed differently.  But marketing strategies
do not define commercial instruments and they
don't justify $250 million windfalls.           Recognizing the weakness of that argument, Delaware alternatively claims that MoneyGram official checks are excluded from the FDA as third- party bank checks. That argument
fares no better because MoneyGram is not a third
party as that term was used in 1974, and MoneyGram's official checks are absolutely not bank checks.
Nor, for that matter, does Delaware
explain why Congress would have chosen to exclude instruments that present precisely the windfall problem that the FDA targeted.
So it's hardly surprising that all
three payment systems experts in this case, including Delaware's own expert, agreed that under any ordinary understanding of the phrase "third-party bank check," MoneyGram official
checks are not third- party bank checks.
So we would ask this Court to overrule
the exceptions and adopt the Special Master's recommendation.

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Why does it describe
the disputed instruments?  Your opposing counsel says the disputed instruments are a class in which the addresses are typically kept.

record actually reflects is that sometimes the addresses are collected by the selling financial

institution, as could be true, frankly, of a retail money order.  So that the statute my
friend was referring to is a requirement that if you sell at least $3,000 worth of these instruments or a retail money order, you're required to collect information and maintain it
as the seller.
That information, however, is not
transmitted to MoneyGram.  MoneyGram has a
policy it will not accept that information.  It will not keep it.  So what that means is the issuer, which is the actual holder of the funds here, because it's not the selling bank that holds the money, the day after a transaction takes place, that money is transferred from the selling financial institution to MoneyG ram, and
it's MoneyGram that holds that -- -that
JUSTICE JACKSON:  But are they still
viable in the teller's check realm?
MR. BRONNI: They --they -- so there
is some jumbling of the record on this point,
unfortunately, Your Honor, but I think what
Delaware's expert ultimately said is, at most, they might be secondarily liable.  But the --the ultimate liability with the so- called
teller's check instrument is MoneyGram because MoneyGram is the issuer.
JUSTICE JACKSON:  And don't we also
have the legislative history that suggests that the inclusion of third -party bank check was
supposed to be a technical or minor change?
The thing that is a little concerning
to me is that if it is used to exclude instruments that function like money orders, then we're talking about a huge carveout to a statute that was designed to solve the inequitable escheatment problem in a way that doesn't seem technical or minor.
MR. BRONNI: That --I absolutely
agree with that, Your Honor, that Treasury, when

it requested this, and it's undisputed, it --yes, it's legislative history in some sense, but
it's really drafting history.  Nobody disputes that --that Treasury requested this exception.
And Treasury characterized it as a
clarifying amendment that was designed to cure
an ambiguity in the statute, which suggests that
it was -- it was -- it was sort of the -- the
narrow change to the statute to make something doubly clear.
And I think the -- defining a
third-party bank check as an ordinary check
really fits that characterization of a clarifying amendment and a narrow sort of belt-and-suspenders approach to make sure that
ordinary checks, which obviously do not present the windfall problem because, one, we have addresses because we have account information, right, but also aren't prepaid.
So that -- that is entirely consistent
with that -- that sort of legislative history.

Rebuttal, Mr. Katyal? REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF NEAL K. KATYAL
ON BEHALF OF DELAWARE
MR. KATYAL: Thank you, Mr. Chief
Justice.  Five points.
First, as the Chief Justice said, they
can solve this problem easily by saying MoneyGram has to have the information.  The information's already being collected by the banks. The only question is closing that informational hi ccup. And that's a lot better,
Justice Sotomayor, than the instrument -by-instrument litigation that will be

invited by their approach.
His answer to that was -- to say to
the Chief Justice, was, well, Congress put its thumb on the scale.  They did with respect to
those two instruments.  The question in this case is, did they do so for anything more than that? And the reasons why Congress isolated
those two instruments don't apply here.
The other point is Congress is the
solution to this.  Even if you don't think states will have this easy fix, which I can't understand to this day why they haven't done it, but Congress can, of course, do that.  That's what you said in the Delaware case in 1993.  If you're worried about equity concerns, Congress should fix it. And what did you point to in that --in that decision?  You literally pointed
to 2503 and said that's the solution if you're worried about equity concerns.
Second, with respect to third -party
banks, my friend says that there's no expert testimony that supports our position.  That's a misreading of the record.  The expert, Ron Mann, just didn't support our position on the words "directly liable" back down below.  As this case

comes to the Court, we agree Professor Mann was
wrong with that.
But, with the definition of
"third-party bank check," I think, Mr. Chief
Justice, you said, well, nobody really knows what it means. We actually think the Hunt Commission does know what it means, and they
told you what it means in that report, and that says teller's checks are included.
Now my friend says --this is our
third point -- that cashier's and certified
checks are different.  Well, first of all, note that he doesn't necessarily -- he doesn't
disclaim them.  He says, well, we're not necessarily saying it.
There's already litigation about
cashier's checks and certified checks, as the ABA brief points out. There have been qui tam lawsuits that have been filed. He says, well, cashier's checks aren't prepaid. Most cashier's and certified checks are prepaid.  The only ones that aren't prepaid are the ones in which banks are paying their own expenses, and our brief explains why we think those types of checks are covered under the statute.

Fourth thing, Justice Sotomayor, you
-- you had said -- or, excuse me, Justice --Justice Jackson, you had said the question in
this case is, what is the field that Congress occupied?  Congress knew exactly how to write the statute they want. They had the 1966 example.  They didn't do that here.  They wrote
a much more narrow statute.
And if you define, Justice Jackson, a
money order as anything that transmits money that is prepaid, you blow up the statute.  It means you can't explain what "traveler's checks" means. You can't explain what is left for "other similar written instruments."  Everything would be a money order.  Nothing would be similar to a --nothing would be similar to it.
And that's why Congress -- we think
you should look to the rationales behind what Congress did.  You pointed to the legislative history and the Treasury Department, but th e
Treasury Department just says essentially that this is a belt -and-suspenders fix.  It doesn't
say that --it doesn't say that -- that -- that
-- something like teller's checks, which the Hunt Commission defined as being a third- party

payment system, wouldn't be included.
And, finally and last, if you adopt
our solution, the common law, it incentivizes
exactly the kind of concerns that Justice Alito was worried about in Yee. It avoids any
questions about these other instruments, from
gift cards to cashier's checks to bearer's bonds and the like, and it avoids threatening the common law primary rule because a primary rule is creditor addresses.  And, Justice Thomas, your opinion in Delaware said that has venerable, old roots going all the way back to Old England.
If they win, forget about place of
incorporation.  If they win, the primary rule of the FDA will control, which is to move away from last creditors' addresses.  That is something that there has been zero support that my friend has offered on the other side for, and that's why that old presumption that you read statutes to avoid derogation of the common law has special force here.
We don't doubt, can you read the
statute the way my friend does?  You can.  But, if you do so, it doesn't make sense of the

statute and threatens all sorts of other financial instruments.  And as the ABA says,
that's something you should be really, really
concerned about in this unique area, particularly because, as Justice Sotomayor
points out, this litigation can go all the way back to 1974 and unwind not just the two
disputed instruments here but every other financial instrument.
The safe thing to do is what you've
done in case after case, which is to say, if we're concerned about equity, that's something for Congress.  It's something for the states. It's not for this Court.
