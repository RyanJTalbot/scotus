JUSTICE KAGAN:  So I -- I guess I
didn't understand until argument that you're saying that "money orders" is an only label test, is that right?  And then the "similar instruments" is where the -- the characteristics
of money orders come in, is that right?
MR. KATYAL: Correct. JUSTICE KAGAN:  And then what are the
characteristics of money orders that you're pointing to?  Like, what --what -- what -- what
does some other non- labeled instrument have to
comply with in order to be determined to be a "similar instrument"?
MR. KATYAL: Well, I do think it would
be a transfer of information in which address

information isn't being collected and a
small-denomination kind of instrument. And so,
here, there's a wide gulf, however you define
"similar," between the two disputed instruments
and -- and agent checks -- excuse me -- and
teller's checks -- traveler's checks and money orders.
And the three things are, number one,
in order to get a disputed instrument, you've got to go to a bank to get it. Second, you will
have a bank account when you do so.  And, third, it's got to be signed by a bank employee.
And that's a pretty important
distinction because, when something is signed by a bank employee, it makes the bank liable for the piece of paper, as opposed to money orders, which are limited recourse documents and you can't sue the issuer of a money order the way you can the two disputed instruments.
So we think those are three hallmarks.
Does that solve the --
JUSTICE KAGAN: So, I mean, it feels
as though you're picking things that, you know, as you should, that -- that -- that make you
succeed in the case.  But I could pick three

other things that make Arkansas succeed.
MR. KATYAL: We're -- we're not just
randomly picking these, Justice Kagan. It goes to, I think, Justice Jackson's question to me
earlier, which is the purpose behind this, which
is the address information isn't being
collected.  It's burdensome to do so. That's a statutory finding.  And the equity windfall considerations.
Here, for these disputed instruments,
the states have the easy fix available to them that wasn't available to them in 1974 because, if states did what this Court invited them to do in 1972 in response to the windfall concern, it would increase the cost of those instruments and be problematic.  And so that's why Congress said, uh- uh, we're heading it off for those
instruments but not for these.
And these factors that I'm referring
to you are relevant to that because they show address information is being collected for the disputed instruments, not being collected for traveler's checks and money orders.  That' s the
key difference between the two.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  So does that mean we
determine cashier's checks one by one by one
depending on whether it's prepaid?
MR. BRONNI: No, Your Honor.  I think
this is one of the reasons why we're judging things sort of on a class of instruments, and as a class of instruments in contrast to official checks and money orders, these are not always prepaid, so that it's a class- wide distinction.
But, even aside from that, there are
other reasons why we believe that cashier's checks, even aside from our definition, would not be swept in under the term "money order."
And one of those reasons is I think,
as, Justice Thomas, your question reflects, you know, so there are instruments in the world that people would not describe as money orders even if they share some of the common core features, and a cashier's check is a good example of that.
We would not in ordinary parlance call
a cashier's check a money order because it is a unique instrument in that it's issued by the

same bank, drawn on that same bank, which makes
it a uniqu ely secure instrument that is
different.
So, in -- in ordinary English, it's a
well-known instrument, as Delaware agrees, as
the American Bankers Association agrees, and that's a justification for carving it out.
And then, finally, another reason why
we would think it wouldn't be covered is because, in 2501, when Congress is describing money orders as a class of instruments, it describes them as a class of instruments for which addresses are not ordinarily kept as a business practice.
That does not describe cashier's
checks in 1974 and it doesn't describe them today.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  If "money order" is as
broad as you're saying it is, what's left for "similar instrument"?
MR. BRONNI: I -- I think, Your Honor,
when --when Congress uses phrases like "money
orders," "traveler's checks" and then follows it by a catch -all, I think what that oftentimes
reflects, as this Court has said, is Congress is -- is concerned with covering the field and not leaving any loopholes.  So it may very well be

that in 1974 there wasn't a product that existed
that wouldn't meet the core definition of what a money order is.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  It was just like a "in
case"?
MR. BRONNI: I -- I -- I think --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Just in case something
comes up or we missed something or whatever?
MR. BRONNI: That's one way of looking
at it. The other option is it's to ensure -- if
you accept Delaware's front- line argument, to
ensure that you can't simply change the label on an instrument and have it be something else.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Yeah, but it might be,
right? I mean, I think that this is the -- the
strength of Mr. Katyal's argument, that they were thinking of something called traveler's checks, they had used traveler's checks, and they were thinking of something called money orders, like the prototypical things that the Chief Justice was talking about, they had seen money orders, they had used money orders, and then they said, "you know, maybe there's some stuff that functions in the same way that does pretty much the same thing, that has similar

characteristics, whatever the relevant characteristics are, so we'll put that third thing in, you know, other similar things."
So that seems to me a --a more l ikely
way of drafting. It's like you have a particular product in mind and another particular product in mind, and then you realize that there are products you don't know about that might function in the same way.
MR. BRONNI: And that --that is -- we
don't disagree that that's a possibility for what happened here.  I just think that the way Congress used the -- when it used the term
"money order" in '73, yes, we might now today typically think of -- of an instrument that's
sold at a retailer.  But the fact is Delaware's own sources describe money orders as instruments sold at financial and non- financial institutions
and that did not have low- dollar limits.
So I -- I think they are money orders,
as Judge Leval said, under any common ordinary understanding, but I agree that, at a minimum, they are certainly similar written instruments because they operate precisely like the instruments that we all agree are money orders.

And if I can address briefly one of
the labeling points that I think the -- the
other side made, that -- that they pointed out,
you know, people -- generally, things are labeled consistent with what you would think they would be. And I think that's right.  You know, most -- they can't -- they don't identify
another product sold by another institution that
works like these.
And that's because this is basically a
product where money order had a business model of selling money orders, and it didn't want to alter the structure of how it does things.  So it -- it put a different label on it and sold it
somewhere else in order to appeal to a different end of the market without fundamentally altering the product itself because they still operate exactly like money orders.
Just like a retail money order, you --
you go in, you -- you prepay for it, you get a
written instrument in response.  The -- the
selling financial institution is merely an agent of MoneyGram.  It's not a party to the instrument.  It's an agent of MoneyGram.  And the -- the day after a transaction takes place,

it forwards the money to MoneyGram.  The selling
financial institution does.
At that point, whether we're talking
about their so -called teller's checks or agent
checks, that selling financial institution is
entirely out of the transaction. It has no more
role. That is the same role that Western Union played on classic money orders in the 1970s.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  You seem to be trying
very hard to exclude various kinds of products. Why is that?  Why not just say, okay, they're all included, that's good?
MR. BRONNI: Well, I --I think, Your
Honor, that when Congress uses -- to -- to go
back to the language of the statute, when it says money orders, traveler's checks, or similar written instruments, it's -- it's referring to two things that had -- traveler's checks and
money orders that had understandings in 1974 that we can rely on.
And by using that terminology and
using those two instruments as an example, it --

other similar written instruments must share
some of those core characteristics of what those
two instruments share.  So I think Congress
decided to limit it.
I -- I -- one point of agreement is I
think there's -- it -- it's probably true, and
the American Bankers Association says this as
well, if Congress wanted to include cashier's
checks, classic cashier's checks, it probably
would have said that.  It knew what that instrument was.  They were well -known
instruments at the time, but they -- they didn't present the windfall problem because, again, addresses were kept typically for cashier's checks just as they are today.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  I --I guess they
failed in that endeavor to make things doubly clear.

MR. BRONNI: I -- well, I -- so the
generous version of this, I think, Your Honor,
is that -- that the way the -- the phraseology
was just sort of used at the time, you know,
we're -- we're sitting here 50 years on and, you know, banking regulators have their own terminology, but the --the thing that I would
emphasize is that, you know, third- party payment
was, in fact, as -- as pointed out in Arkansas's
appendix at 177, so common that The Washington Post said that a third -party payment today means
essentially a checking account.
So that was ordinary phraseology
that --that maybe has gone by the wayside, but
it is phraseology that was used at the time.
Unless there are --JUSTICE ALITO:  Your argument is that
in 1974 everybody would have known what a third-party bank check means? I actually do
remember 1974.

regulators might have known what it meant. Maybe not ordinary people.  But --
