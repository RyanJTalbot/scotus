MoneyGram treats one of its other official checks, the agent check money orders, as subject to the FDA. Justice Thomas asked you what happens if they remove that tomorrow.
Under your test that you just
articulated to Justice Kagan, then it would go back to not being a money order?
MR. KATYAL: No, Your Honor.  If I
understand your question, it's the same
instrument.  It just doesn't have the label "money order" on it.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  They take it off. MR. KATYAL: Yeah.  If they take it
off --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It's issued by --
MR. KATYAL: -- that is an other --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- it's issued by
a bank --
MR. KATYAL: Right. JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- not a retail
operator.  They do collect information, don't they?
MR. KATYAL: For agent check money
orders, I think some information is collected, yes.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right.  And
what was your third criteria?
MR. KATYAL: That --that you have to
have an account at the bank and --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And they have an
account at the bank.
MR. KATYAL: -- and they may have an
account at the bank.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So --
MR. KATYAL: So, with respect to that,
you know, limited universe, we do -- even there, I guess I should say, let's look at that, Justice Sotomayor.  It's at page 230 and 231, is an agent check money order.
And so what it says on the front is
that --there's a picture of it, and it says on
the front that -- you know, that it's labeled
agent check money order.  And then, on the back, it says, if the instrument is designated on its face as a money order, then the following applies, and it says it's limited recourse.
Now, if you strike that off from the
back, then you might be -- then I think you are
fundamentally changing the nature of the document because you're making it now not a

limited recourse document; you're making it
something else.
And so that actually is a substantive
change.  I think it's a -- and the reason --
that's why I'm going through this, because it's
different very much --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's not the
example I gave.
MR. KATYAL: --than Justice Thomas's
hypothetical.  So our view on this is generally labels will control.  In some circumstances, if you have the very same product, just not the label, then that is an other similar instrument.
But, for your question, which is
actually changing the meaning of the document itself, then that isn't one that is an other similar written instrument.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's what he
tried to do, correct?
MR. BRONNI: Correct.  I think, Your
Honor, that --that Judge Leval's approach made
sense in that, under any ordinary understanding of the term "money order" as the sources, Delaware's sources -- again, the ABA report on
money orders from the late 1950s, the Compton's Encyclopedia define money order. It include s
instruments sold by financial institutions, not in low-dollar amounts, and it includes
instruments like the agent check money order here.
And I think that is the -- when --
when Congress adopted the term "money order," it

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You haven't
answered my question.
MR. BRONNI: I -- I -- I think that it
--it meets any ordinary definition.  So I -- I
-- I don't think that it does any harm to define
it that way.  I know they present -- we started
with a parade of horribles, for instance --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Do we do less
parade of horribles if we define it your way? Because you take care of cashier's checks and, I presume, certified checks by calling them a prepaid -- a prepaid draft, correct?
MR. BRONNI: Correct.  I -- the reason
why I struggle with this is -- is I think both
things are -- are sort of -- neither one does that much harm because, again, they're alluding to this possibility of a parade of horribles, but they don't point to anything that would present that --that parade of horribles. You
know, cashier's checks, even if you --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, you waited
how long to sue?  They're afraid of all the guys who are going to come after -- come and sue now.
And they have good reason to worry because, once

we write a decision, the world will have the
roadmap.
MR. BRONNI: So what I would say to
that, Your Honor, is that -- that at least
outside of the context of this case, I'm not aware of a situation where anybody -- they
allude, for instance, to private realtors, not
to states having brought suits over cashier's checks, and even in those cases, nobody that I'm aware of is arguing that a cashier's check is a money order.  Instead, those cases are all about the "similar written instruments" clause.
But either way, I don't think that our
definition, as I started by saying, necessarily requires treating them that way. I think they're well- known instruments.  And if -- if
Congress had intended to include them, it probably would have used that language because they were well -known instruments at the time and
they just don't fit what Congress describes in 2501 as --as a money order because they're not
instruments for which addresses weren't kept as a business practice.

Justice Gorsuch?  No? Justice Barrett?
Justice Jackson? JUSTICE JACKSON:  One final question. So Justice Kagan pointed out that
Congress might have been intending to cover the
field with this statute.  And I guess my question is, so what --what is the field? It
seems as though your friend says that really
Congress was worried about no addresses, and, as a result, large- money instruments wouldn't fit
in the statute because there was an incentive to have addresses.
And I understood you to be focusing on
Congress's be -- concern about inequitable escheatment, in which case these instruments would be covered.  So can you just, as a final word here, talk about what the purpose of this statute is?
MR. BRONNI: I -- I -- I -- well, I'll
start with the purpose of the statute is to address those instruments that presented the windfall inequity problem associated with the Court's common law rule.
I think what they're suggesting is

there would be an incentive to keep addresses
for larger -dollar instruments.  However, this
case is a prime example of that hasn't happened. These are larger -dollar instruments, and
MoneyGram does not keep addresses.
And it's the -- the -- the point here
is that it's the issuer. It's the party that is actually responsible for paying these instruments. It's the party that holds the unclaimed property.  And it hasn't kept those --
address information.  So, I mean, to the extent Delaware's suggesting that that somehow makes a difference here, the record just doesn't bear that out.
But, again, going back to the -- the
-- the other point about -- you know, Congress's
actual concern was not just the low- dollar
instruments.  Congress's concern was that requiring addresses to be kept for money orders as a class of instruments and other similar written instruments would be an additional burden that is not justified in light of the fact that people buy these instruments where they do their banking.  They buy them in their home state.

So, if you required addresses and all
the burdens that go along with that, it's simply going to reflect the same place. So what
Congress is saying in 2501 is, to use Learned Hand's phrase, the game is not worth the candle here. Congress just decided it was easier just to have these instruments escheat to the state of purchase, regardless of what their value
would be.
