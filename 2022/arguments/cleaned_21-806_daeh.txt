mr chief justice may please court congress established oversight board assigned critical task leading puerto rico back fiscal health congress enacted number protections board one section promesa gives federal courts exclusive jurisdiction suits board first circuit held abrogated boards immunity fact every type suit federal territorial decision wrong reversed order abrogate statute must clear unmistakable face nothing section even comes close heritage reporting corporation official court held many times jurisdictional provisions abrogate power hear case says nothing availability defense mere textual inferences qualify separately cpi raised issue whether puerto rico therefore board entitled sovereign immunity board believes court need reach issue court repeatedly held hundred years puerto rico immunity held way puerto ricos constitutional assembly since said puerto rico degree sovereignty excuse autonomy comparable state cpis theory puerto rico immunity courts would mean puerto rico governor officials could sued puerto ricos law federal court would sea change puerto rico extremely harmful one welcome courts questions justice thomas would difference puerto rico state argument mr harris think far argument would would concerned would heritage reporting corporation official difference justice thomas would congress able adopt enact promesa apply state manner mr harris may difference source authority congress would rely wouldnt article iv course congress power abrogate appropriate circumstances long power rule would apply clear unmistakable clear unmistakable statement intent abrogate justice thomas one final question would know preference assume immunity would since prefer assume immunity would tease bit basis territory sovereign immunity respect applying sovereign immunity courts federal courts example superior court territorial court one local courts mr harris sure position sovereign immunity territory part large body large doctrine constitutional common law common law sovereign immunity goes different heritage reporting corporation official names idea behind congress gives certain attributes sovereignty organic act example territory common law basically dictates result sovereignty point entitled immunity courts federal court two different strands though want emphasize associated common sovereign immunity theyre important rationales slightly different one principle sovereign haled court without consenting haled way principle would mean puerto rico could sued without consent federal court theres second strand think even powerful sovereign lawmaker part sovereignty aspect lawmaker power autonomy decide law applies puerto rico passes territorial law puerto rico able decide law apply cpis theory sovereignty applies territorial court would mean would heritage reporting corporation official happened could happen puerto rico could pass law federal court puerto rico could sued law would serious invasion puerto ricos sovereignty autonomy hold responsible way chief justice roberts analogize argument sovereign immunity states sovereign immunity tribes wonder puerto ricos situation though significantly different respect states respect tribes sovereignty time convention carried forward states carried forward tribes carried forward puerto rico obviously point points past sovereignty spain carry sense question would extent constitution recognized existing sovereignty question would constitution way confer sovereignty create sovereignty respect puerto rico far plan convention goes plan convention cover territories plenary authority congresss part notion sovereignty heritage reporting corporation official mr harris position sovereignty depend history position adopted court history matters sanchez valle case really purpose double jeopardy analysis think court went way sanchez valle say standard rule fact think court said ordinary meaning sovereignty like happened chief justice roberts right ill give ill give mr harris okay question whether sovereign immunity think theres two steps involved one congress confer attributes sovereignty onto entity usually organic act several organic acts even important constitutional assembly court said many times really made puerto rico unique gave chief justice roberts well thats right thats sort point unique im wondering far stretch analogy state sovereign immunity tribal sovereign immunity heritage reporting corporation official mr harris unique know would take position unique know favor sovereignty chief justice roberts right justice jackson isnt first position really get mean didnt see briefs little concerned relying sort views based things hasnt really briefed could talk little bit assumption position whether extent assume purpose answering question actually decided take case mr harris yes justice jackson agree court need reach issue question presented addressed issue whether section abrogates issue sovereign immunity raised us justice jackson say sgs position go ahead reach nonetheless mean whos got better argument regarding assumption mr harris position court appropriate circumstances assumed heritage reporting corporation official predicate issue like sovereign immunity exists court cpi think acknowledged opposition cert certiorari really wasnt none arguments made twotiered theory sovereign immunity cpi pressing raised first circuit simply following precedents really analysis agree court said many times court review first view therefore court doesnt need reach issue justice sotomayor counsel reach issue tremendous implications outside promesa doesnt mr harris yes justice sotomayor justice sotomayor lets go back foundational question justice thomas justice roberts territories like louisiana others didnt sovereignty became territories united states correct mr harris correct justice sotomayor sovereignty france countries correct mr harris cases yes justice sotomayor historically heritage reporting corporation official territory dragged federal state territorial courts unless sovereignty waived correct mr harris yes justice sotomayor years history holmes justice holmess proposition sovereign think given mean governing entity would dragged court without consent sovereign correct mr harris yes justice sotomayor extent united states permitted entertained looked suits territories theyve acted akin states correct mr harris yes justice sotomayor thats said long line cases rosaly emadeline said puerto rico like state correct mr harris correct justice sotomayor right taken propositions given assuming sovereignty government government adversary says okay acts like state act means sovereignty territorial courts doesnt heritage reporting corporation official sovereignty federal court address subset argument mr harris justice sotomayor position twotiered theory sovereign immunity puerto rico sovereignty immunity courts theres precedent fact would counterintuitive would lead counterintuitive results theres authority situation able find court ever said sovereign court ever said sovereign immunity courts would lead lot justice sotomayor fact thats holmes talking general proposition broader cant haled court mr harris yes exactly second point would lead strange results one results would territory lets say citizens territory tried sue territory courts would able hypothesis doesnt immunity immunity heritage reporting corporation official situation noncitizens taking advantage diversity jurisdiction could sue exact law federal court sovereign chief justice roberts mr harris really doesnt make sense chief justice roberts eleventh amendment say states things like states mr harris eleventh amendment says states justice sotomayor meaning government saying eleventh amendment immunity first circuit relied common law foreign sovereignty isnt reason remand let look issue closely mr harris dont think theres need remand think first eleventh amendment analysis actually justice sotomayor dont mean remand mean answer question answer question presented issue could addressed fully correct mr harris yes could fact court actually left open question whether eleventh amendment applies puerto rico heritage reporting corporation official relying argument dont need court left open puerto rico aqueduct case footnote chief justice roberts understand court appeals relying argument mr harris court appeals series holdings think original holding justice breyer court eleventh amendment principles apply think time court said eleventh amendment applies thats longstanding precedent first circuit applied relying argument dont think need open question think common law common sovereign immunity principle tribes rely enough give territories general puerto rico specific sovereign immunity justice sotomayor way tribes like puerto rico congress controls dependent sovereign nations congress waive immunity well correct mr harris absolutely congress heritage reporting corporation official justice sotomayor said tribes cant sued federal court correct mr harris thats correct plenary power congress far tribes concerned exactly regard territory cant prove theres sovereign immunity would true tribes case court held otherwise justice kagan may may take back mr harris justice jacksons questions assumption rightly point assume questions time way holding usually assume question say well going assume anyway lose different ground want us something different want us assume immunity question say well win respect abrogation thats funny kind posture know assumption essentially determine disposition case youre going get immunity weve assumed get immunity wonder precedent cases weve done something similar authority suggest appropriate dont know heritage reporting corporation official authority say inappropriate seems quite weird mr harris able find case seemed existence immunity would mattered outcome court assumed nevertheless mentioned justice kagan cases dont seem give reason okay assume several cases cited think feeney case said going assume happened case consent jurisdiction didnt impact outcome court didnt say reason justice gorsuch address larger question implicated justice kagan sovereign immunity least affirmative defense would normally burden would person asserting establish make particularly odd circumstance assume existence mr harris dont know changes things think think situations party may bear burden particular question court nevertheless assumes agree doesnt seem case court done specifically regard heritage reporting corporation official sovereign immunity think principle stands mean reason id mention well would may appropriate assume parties parties would think would interested answer question example puerto rico authorities present case governor puerto rico puerto rico parties would make sense least let weigh perhaps another case question justice sotomayor alternative ground immunity could found waived besides promesa act would puerto rican constitution laws waive sovereign immunity suits like one know say dont assuming argument addressed correct mr harris argument correct argument never raised never addressed court simply case justice sotomayor well came us raised respondent heritage reporting corporation official mr harris yes justice sotomayor could raised correct mr harris could raised another case yes could chief justice roberts thank counsel justice thomas justice alito anything justice sotomayor justice kagan justice gorsuch one question follow justice sotomayors received lot briefing puerto ricos constitution promoting open records understand procedural objections addressing case want say anything substance argument mr harris substance justice gorsuch merits argument whether puerto rico constitution favors disclosure cases like mr harris thing would say waiver argument think significant clear whether waiver heritage reporting corporation official would even apply federal court first place words fact puerto rico agreed consented suits governmental entities courts follow done federal court fact statute implements constitutional right statute called tepra puerto rico statute gives right go obtain document government records go court dont get clearly written assumption go territorial court section says know judicial review says court first instance justice gorsuch thank chief justice roberts justice kavanaugh justice barrett justice jackson thank counsel mr harris thank chief justice roberts ms brown oral argument aimee w brown united states amicus curiae supporting vacatur ms brown thank mr chief justice may please court heritage reporting corporation official century court recognized puerto rico immune sued without consent immunity derives nature puerto ricos government extends sovereigns court federal court federal state tribal immunity waiver abrogation puerto ricos sovereign immunity requires clear statement section promesa include statement simply channels jurisdiction federal court claim board federal territorial law claims proceed boards immunity elsewhere abrogated waived provisions promesa respondent relies likewise apply context relevantly title proceedings bankruptcy code abrogates immunity nothing provision indicate congress intended make board susceptible suit claims federal territorial law boards immunity also subject waiver commonwealth long waiver doesnt conflict promesa court remand allow lower courts address issue heritage reporting corporation official welcome courts questions justice thomas take different position respect assuming sovereign immunity brief could comment argument could could possibly assume sovereign immunity ms brown position kind consistent justice kagan referencing earlier usually court assumed without deciding question doesnt effect end outcome think would little bit strange assume take view think correct view correct reading statute clearly abrogate immunity think would little bit strange address existence immunity first place also think think necessary try avoid question courts precedents dating back century already decided puerto rico entitled immunity think appropriate address question first instance justice thomas case heritage reporting corporation official territory granted said sovereign immunity another sovereigns courts ms brown think closest case score emmanuel case course court ended holding territory waived immunity didnt really wasnt necessary outcome case court certainly went discussion sovereign immunity case seems implication applies equally territorial court federal court justice sotomayor ever heard case deciding sovereignty entity entity us ms brown kind nature case set think cert papers think court aware granted issue respondent intended take issue justice jackson granted understood least question whether also consider sovereignty point didnt grant cert issue seemed though court isolating abrogation heritage reporting corporation official ms brown court chooses consider issue decide basis think dont precedent says impossible justice jackson theres legal impediment identify ms brown im aware think kind strange thing case end mattering outcome starts look little bit like advisory opinion event justice jackson wait matter mean intertwined could could totally understand concern assumption way could possibly answer abrogation question would based particular findings made relative sovereign immunity youre sort like even reach answer two things intertwined understood antecedent sovereign immunity question independent sense doesnt rely factors ms brown think thats generally correct statutory interpretation could heritage reporting corporation official affected think ways fact existence immunity extent kind looking statutory language think provisions meaning extent waiver sovereign immunity territorial law certain provisions could end affecting way court views statute think kind balance justice kagan think theres difference kind clear statement rule could come depending basis immunity going question whether intertwined know depending basis sovereign immunity case could possibly lead different clear statement rule ms brown think clear statement rule applied every context involving sovereign immunity think kind necessary corollary existence selfgovernment first instance thats way court described bay mills example court said know selfgovernment exists particularly heritage reporting corporation official hesitant conclude congress acting undermine selfgovernment think analysis applies course tribes plenary authority congress way territories think analysis would likely regardless justice gorsuch counsel considered sovereign immunity argument might apply territories besides puerto rico views may ms brown think territories likely kind baseline level selfgovernance court recognized rosaly sufficient necessarily leads sovereign immunity courts theres ninth circuit opinion believe holds respect northern mariana islands provisions within compact congress covenant congress case waive sovereign immunity particular instances might differences respect terms sovereign immunity baseline existence think justice gorsuch ruling case would effectively decide puerto rico heritage reporting corporation official territories arent us well ms brown thats thats likely case think based selfgovernment justice gorsuch thank justice jackson chief justice roberts justice jackson reach ms brown reach sovereign justice jackson sovereign immunity ms brown yes exactly justice jackson right justice sotomayor counsel chief justice roberts get justice sotomayor im sorry chief justice roberts go ahead justice sotomayor cases involving jurisdiction weve addressed whether one jurisdictional ground present remanded see said could others correct yes could ms brown yes believe believe thats case chief justice roberts question justice gorsuch part answer think territories heritage reporting corporation official level selfgovernment true ms brown sufficient baseline level think puerto rico kind stands apart additional immunity additional sovereignty additional selfgovernance separate apart immunity decided back foraker act implemented point think territories least baseline level level given rise sovereign immunity justice sotomayor level court looked rosaly correct ms brown thats correct yes justice sotomayor said islands like sovereigns sense haled court ms brown yes justice sotomayor justice kagan chief justice roberts rosaly justice sotomayor emmanuel said federal court well correct ms brown emmanuel yes following year applied kind reasoning heritage reporting corporation official federal court chief justice roberts well mean rosaly simply courts puerto rico right ms brown court issue rosaly yes justice kagan would define baseline level sovereignty think gives rise immunity ms brown court rosaly shell co kind described selfgovernance autonomy matters local concern court compared government legislative power granted territories granted organized incorporated territories found essentially identical think general youre governing issues local concern chief justice roberts justice thomas justice alito justice sotomayor anything justice kavanaugh justice kavanaugh remand heritage reporting corporation official point make side says theres need remand issue never raised previously lower courts respond ms brown think havent taken position whether issue forfeited think remand court could decide well certainly think references briefing fact constitutional right generally available territories perhaps would would sufficient raise dont think would appropriate necessary court actually reach decide full extent commonwealth law think questions whether laws right access documents generally brought actions government territory territorial officers something like ex parte young suit think theres amicus brief espacios abiertos kind discusses general writ mandamus notes heritage reporting corporation official generally applied officers territory justice kavanaugh thank chief justice roberts justice barrett justice jackson thank counsel ms brown thank chief justice roberts ms harris oral argument sarah harris behalf respondent ms harris mr chief justice may please court congress need surmount clear statement rule subject board suit violating puerto ricos constitution court required historical constitutional basis clear statement rules puerto rico territory clear statement rule abrogating state sovereign immunity unlike states tribes court never imposed clear statement rules congress curtail territorial autonomy court ever imposed clear statement rules waivers abrogations territorial immunity clear statement rules would conflict heritage reporting corporation official congresss plenary powers territories adopting sides onesizefitsall theory immunity would drastic unnecessary way protect puerto rico flooded federal suits matter federal relations act already gives puerto rico benefits state sovereign immunity generally applicable federal laws diversity jurisdiction suits territories regardless board immune promesas text clearly says board defendant kinds actions especially constitutional ones creates reticulated federal review scheme action board congress created forum board face suit generic class defendants prescribes court orders board including constitutional violations take effect federal courts couldnt issue orders board immune constitutional violations cover puerto ricos constitution promesa shunts federal territorial claims board federal court congress didnt suspend puerto ricos constitution waiver immunity unelected board heritage reporting corporation official one part puerto ricos government entitled immunity people puerto rico withdrew everyone else welcome courts questions justice thomas ms harris could comment argument weve heard suggestion bypass sovereign immunity simply decide abrogation ms harris dont think plausible order rule us least court would say sort clear statement applies abrogation analysis apply promesa begs question clear statement rule come underlying immunity protected justice gorsuch noted strange assume sovereign immunity affirmative defense opinion would read something like clear statement rule based mean state sovereign immunity cases thats board relied briefing first circuit also opening brief court dont think justice jackson dont understand justice gorsuch ms heritage reporting corporation official justice jackson lead clear statement rule thought could assumes circumstances could sovereignty without clear statement rule doesnt sort initial question rather clear statement initial question puerto rico entitled status sovereign assume first circuit relying precedent respect courts cases suggested event every time recognition sovereign immunity clear statement rule follows wouldnt opinion read like ms harris bakes lot assumptions respect idea clear statement rules sort like buy one get one free sufficiently sovereign form immunity think refuted courts cases territories justice jackson cases territories case suggests find sovereign immunity applies theres another set analyses determine whether clear statement follows heritage reporting corporation official ms harris yes would say jinks good example least respect counties immune state court court said dont need clear statement rule abrogate immunity counties common law immunity courts cases dont sort squarely say think problem courts cases dont sort squarely like ever say universal unified theory sovereign immunity courts justice jackson dont understand justice gorsuch ms justice jackson dont understand case every time weve found sovereign immunity say clear statement rule follows ms harris case one case would point actually rosaly think everyone agrees court saying absolutely certainly sovereign immunity puerto rico courts case also involves question waiver whether foraker act waived puerto ricos immunity courts even assume theres immunity elsewhere whether waived heritage reporting corporation official court apply clear statement rule case instead looked ordinary principles statutory interpretation actually case came courts conclusion design foraker act grant coequal three coequal branches puerto rico would inconsistent reading waiver think underscores rosaly focused idea puerto rico legislature another political branch constantly haled courts puerto rico would inconsistent government congress trying set emmanuel justice gorsuch ms justice sotomayor counsel justice gorsuch ms harris justice sotomayor go ahead justice gorsuch im sorry justice sotomayor go ahead justice gorsuch wanted explore suggestion petitioners avoid issue altogether assume existence sovereign immunity purposes case arguments think strong dont puerto rico heritage reporting corporation official us board may expire creation congress dont territories us well rather large important constitutional question really may relevant small number cases given statute congress effectively given puerto rico sovereign immunity purposes point general purpose federal statutes opposition cert client stated first circuit correctly framed inquiry whether congress used unmistakably clear language abrogate sovereign immunity case arent good reasons defer question another day ever becomes relevant given congresss statute saying puerto rico generally sovereign immunity ms harris first would little bit ironic board say entitled share puerto ricos sovereign immunity part government say justice gorsuch ironies aside legal impediment proceeding way ms harris yes think heritage reporting corporation official legal impediment go cert papers werent conceding clear statement rule applies saying universe asking first circuit misapply standard doesnt apply impediment would opinion would justice gorsuch im sure understand impediment explain mean thats ms harris concession impediment would way opinion would framed justice gorsuch say concession fine ill ill spot without granting ms harris okay justice gorsuch okay im looking legal impediment proceeding petitioner suggests ms harris yes legal impediment would would writing opinion says assuming theres clear statement rule hold clear statement rule essentially saying yes sort basis courts cases historically constitutional heritage reporting corporation official matter actually apply puerto rico territories youre concerned sort inquiry mean seems like maybe one better ideas would consider whether case either resolved also look many alternative offramps case including waiver question respect puerto rico constitutions structural waiver immunity circumstances could also say promesa clear enough terms terms entirely reticulated specific judicial review scheme board meaning remedies constitutional violations fact say justice sotomayor goes back ultimate question mean clear rule sovereign youre waiving sovereign immunity youre analogizing puerto rico municipality see irony anybody claiming puerto rico united states sovereign purposes selfgovernment agree theyre correct ms harris united states puerto heritage reporting corporation official rico courts cases say sovereignty puerto rico comes united states important difference justice sotomayor well territories became states ms harris justice sotomayor everybody gets sovereignty united states including tribes determined take away ms harris clear fundamental difference states come union equal footing doctrine tribes territories think significant respect justice sotomayor indians everybody else question weve announced clear statement rule respect waiver youve given reason puerto rico treated differently indians treated differently territories somehow clear statement rule shouldnt apply rosaly way nineteenteens sometime decades started clear statement rule thats weve got ms harris heritage reporting corporation official justice sotomayor rosaly addressing theory doctrine wasnt existence yet ms harris points starting last one rosaly actually exact time court articulating clear statement rules federal waivers immunity state sovereign immunity marie case cited briefing example clear statement rule abrogating state sovereign immunity schillinger case united states example federal government really telling several cases territories waivers abrogation immunity time mention clear statement rule think reason one among many basis clear statement rules immunity states tribes united states fundamentally different let start tribes thats sort bandied analogy tribes differ three ways first sovereignty akin sovereignty foreign nation tribes founding government fact dealt heritage reporting corporation official tribes treaties retained status socalled law nations immunity immunity peoples courts virtue reason clear statement rule tribes sort flows bit congress plenary power tribes strong understanding united states functions least court said like trustee tribes assume congress trying eliminate autonomy tribes assumptions go obviously window respect territories third thing tribes longstanding history related canons tribes discussion various canons construing statutes ambiguous tribes favor preserve sovereignty look territory cases many dating back century find clear statement rule rosaly emmanuel come discussion good examples considerations waivers immunity emmanuel sort assuming could immunity heritage reporting corporation official discussion even parsing statutes cases whether needs satisfied clear statement dont think theres way could say inquiry emmanuel came close satisfying clear statement rule chief justice roberts justice barrett ms chief justice roberts began opening statement said clear statement rule would interfere congresss powers dont understand quite clear statement rule says clear maybe apply rule across board doesnt prevent congress whatever wants make clear sort like fuss whether thats significant infringement congresss power ms harris well think lot fuss lot statutes would otherwise applicable territories without without additional hoop clear statement rule mean clear statement rule departure ordinary understanding youre simply parsing text looking best reading court historically required constitutional heritage reporting corporation official basis least historical pedigree foist clear statement rule cases justice jackson isnt isnt constraint courts really know putting impediment restraining congress way understood clear statement rule preventing us finding something crystalclear congress intended ms harris think certainly state sovereign immunity cases absolutely framed constraint congress idea constitutionally sensitive ground shouldnt hold congress higher standard congress sort justice jackson well holding standard mean agree know chief justice makes good point congress wants policy makes determinations things like clear statement rules preventing court foisting view congress done statute isnt crystalclear implications severe situation know implication court something heritage reporting corporation official congress didnt intend stripping territory perhaps intended sovereign immunity ms harris think problem text text statute normally stops courts adding additional layer clear statement rule something much requiring degree specificity clarity unusual statutes point court demanded sort historical pedigree sort reason constitutional avoidance impose additional barrier whether look need make sure courts arent going sensitive areas accident guardrail congress dont think matters key thing constitutional imperative unlike states federal government guard sovereign immunity unlike tribes historical pedigree basis foisting clear statement rule would justice barrett ms ms harris unusual justice kagan justice barrett go ahead heritage reporting corporation official justice kagan go ahead justice barrett go ahead fine chief justice roberts justice kagan justice kagan know im curious much question mr harris ive lost opportunity think congress currently understands puerto ricos immunity usually clear statement rules operate backdrop congressional understanding needs clear clear statement rule know clear abrogation congress doesnt think puerto rico immunity would think abrogation even picture evidence congress understands sovereign immunity would enable us read statute better ms harris think best perhaps evidence text federal relations act actually recurs theres similar language territories need say generally applicable federal laws force effect states puerto rico suggests congress may thought reason heritage reporting corporation official think instance reciprocity states immunity give statutory benefit puerto rico would sort seem suggest congress understands puerto rico would immunity force mean think indication congress seems understand eleventh amendment fact states congress super clear types abrogation side seems embrace says states shall immune eleventh amendment talking territories create oddities think view im sure clear statement rule territories like language would abrogate territories create sort oddities federal statutes thats think fact congress seem operating baseline sovereign immunity reflective courts cases never said federal courts puerto rico fact enjoys immunity best muddy muddied yet fact federal courts directly reviewing decisions puerto rico courts territorial heritage reporting corporation official courts territorial claims like well century justice barrett ms harris vacate remand first circuit given complexities question raise good points governments raised good points common law immunity question question whether territories vacate let first circuit know long line precedent hasnt really fully engaged question let ms harris well think would unfair give side mulligan boards argument along mean argued weve argued along puerto rico eleventh amendment immunity affirmative burden show immunity theyve written case along sole ground eleventh amendment pennhurst things want point would little unfair say going vacate know first circuit think especially unnecessary given everyone appears firmly agree puerto rico constitution includes waiver immunity heritage reporting corporation official particular case constitutional claims reason say look mean youre youre saying like might counsel favor dismissing improvidently granted instead getting rid first circuits opinion justice kavanaugh posture whats proper us first circuit said immunity statute abrogate immunity petitioner court come two questions first theres sovereign immunity puerto rico second question even sovereign immunity statute clear statement abrogating youd raise two questions cert petition would improper us grant second question grant first question ms harris dont think often often petitioners respondents alternative questions beltandsuspenders approach try clarify whats really issue dont think conceded would fairly say embedded question immunity within clear statement rule mean think thats heritage reporting corporation official courts cases essentially talking theres talking clear statement rules courts immunity cases without talking reason state sovereign immunity federal governments immunity suit tribes immunity suit truly inextricably linked clear statement rule begs question distorting ordinary sort putting thumb scale wouldnt otherwise apply justice sotomayor counsel dig creating two layers issues never get resolved others going sue puerto rico claims besides ones youre raising first circuit said theres clear abrogation issue control least note differences address question presented remand consideration issues least say open questions reviewed looked dig going get us ms harris justice sotomayor going invite lawsuits different kinds lawsuits heritage reporting corporation official controlled precedent nobody said looked ms harris clear lawsuits would universe lawsuits really would specific promesa board would justice sotomayor well thats unimportant ms harris unimportant think counter argument know court commonwealth puerto rico isnt people arent think case indicated people could participate board claiming puerto rico terms justice sotomayor dont invite amici say choose dont tell fact discourage ms harris respectfully think respect question promesa yes could could reserve questions would fine mean think theyre open questions matter would still decide think get position vacating first circuits decision sort abrogation sufficiently clear heritage reporting corporation official minimum youre going addressing question statute refers orders constitutional violations clearly taking effect board abrogation constitutional violations dont think theres way say happens without sort abrogation happening promesa even clear statement rule side pointed title bankruptcy proceedings simply incorrect answer abrogation constitutional violations two reasons first congress wanted refer title basis orders constitutional violations presumably would done section actually refer expressly carveout title reticulated judicial review scheme second abrogation type claims board pointing would get abrogation title orders remedying constitutional violations let explain title discussion incorporates reference section bankruptcy heritage reporting corporation official code abrogates sovereign immunity different types bankruptcy proceedings looked none include cause action standalone separate proceedings type board pointing sort standalone actions type board would result remedy constitutional violations board pointed cases didnt actually raise immunity title context government seemed discomfort hanging case ground promesa abrogation question think minimum complicated anything tilts favor given language even clear statement rule explain sides view
