5 This case presents the problem the FDA
6 was enacted to solve. In Pennsylvania versus
7 New York, this Court concluded that unclaimed
8 financial instruments escheat to a purchaser's
9 state of residence or, if that's unknown, to an
10 issuer's state of incorporation.
11 Because issuers of certain financial
12 instruments rarely kept purchaser addresses,
13 that meant a windfall for an issuer's state of
14 incorporation at the expense of its fellow
15 states.
16 Just two years later, Congress
17 responded to that inequity by enacting the FDA.
18 That statute says that where addresses aren't
19 typically kept for a class of instruments, those
20 instruments escheat to the state of purchase.
21 Now, 50 years later, Delaware claims
22 that it's entitled to the exact same sort of
23 windfall that led to the enactment of the FDA.
24 To justify that, it argues that the
25 FDA doesn't cover instruments that function
Heritage Reporting CorporationOfficial
38
1 precisely like other money orders but are
2 marketed differently. But marketing strategies
3 do not define commercial instruments and they
4 don't justify $250 million windfalls.
5 Recognizing the weakness of that
6 argument, Delaware alternatively claims that
7 MoneyGram official checks are excluded from the
8 FDA as third-party bank checks. That argument
9 fares no better because MoneyGram is not a third
10 party as that term was used in 1974, and
11 MoneyGram's official checks are absolutely not
12 bank checks.
13 Nor, for that matter, does Delaware
14 explain why Congress would have chosen to
15 exclude instruments that present precisely the
16 windfall problem that the FDA targeted.
17 So it's hardly surprising that all
18 three payment systems experts in this case,
19 including Delaware's own expert, agreed that
20 under any ordinary understanding of the phrase
21 "third-party bank check," MoneyGram official
22 checks are not third-party bank checks.
23 So we would ask this Court to overrule
24 the exceptions and adopt the Special Master's
25 recommendation.

1 JUSTICE THOMAS: Mr. Bronni, would you
2 spend a few minutes on the -- Mr. Katyal's
3 parade of horribles if we accept your argument?
4 MR. BRONNI: Sure, Your Honor. I
5 think it's probably easiest to begin with --
6 with the example of cashier's checks because
7 there's been a lot of ink spilled on the
8 cashier's check at issue in this case. And --
9 and, for that one, we don't believe that
10 cashier's checks are necessarily covered by our
11 definition.
12 So, to -- to begin with, our
13 definition requires that an instrument be
14 prepaid. A cashier's check as a class of
15 instrument is not necessarily a prepaid
16 instrument. Instead, as the ABA's amicus brief
17 argues at length, there are many frequent,
18 common, ordinary, everyday situations where
19 cashier's checks are not prepaid.
20 So, for instance, if a bank needs to
21 pay its own obligations, say it needs to pay an
22 electrician or meet a tax bill, it will issue a
23 check drawn on its own accounts. That's a
24 cashier's check. That is not a prepaid
25 instrument.
Heritage Reporting CorporationOfficial
40
1 If the bank needs to disburse loan
2 proceeds, it will issue a check drawn on its own
3 accounts.
4 JUSTICE KAGAN: So does that mean we
5 determine cashier's checks one by one by one
6 depending on whether it's prepaid?
7 MR. BRONNI: No, Your Honor. I think
8 this is one of the reasons why we're judging
9 things sort of on a class of instruments, and as
10 a class of instruments in contrast to official
11 checks and money orders, these are not always
12 prepaid, so that it's a class-wide distinction.
13 But, even aside from that, there are
14 other reasons why we believe that cashier's
15 checks, even aside from our definition, would
16 not be swept in under the term "money order."
17 And one of those reasons is I think,
18 as, Justice Thomas, your question reflects, you
19 know, so there are instruments in the world that
20 people would not describe as money orders even
21 if they share some of the common core features,
22 and a cashier's check is a good example of that.
23 We would not in ordinary parlance call
24 a cashier's check a money order because it is a
25 unique instrument in that it's issued by the
Heritage Reporting CorporationOfficial
41
1 same bank, drawn on that same bank, which makes
2 it a uniquely secure instrument that is
3 different.
4 So, in -- in ordinary English, it's a
5 well-known instrument, as Delaware agrees, as
6 the American Bankers Association agrees, and
7 that's a justification for carving it out.
8 And then, finally, another reason why
9 we would think it wouldn't be covered is
10 because, in 2501, when Congress is describing
11 money orders as a class of instruments, it
12 describes them as a class of instruments for
13 which addresses are not ordinarily kept as a
14 business practice.
15 That does not describe cashier's
16 checks in 1974 and it doesn't describe them
17 today.
18 JUSTICE JACKSON: Why does it describe
19 the disputed instruments? Your opposing counsel
20 says the disputed instruments are a class in
21 which the addresses are typically kept.
22 MR. BRONNI: So I -- I -- I think that
23 sometimes the addresses -- I think what the
24 record actually reflects is that sometimes the
25 addresses are collected by the selling financial
Heritage Reporting CorporationOfficial
42
1 institution, as could be true, frankly, of a
2 retail money order. So that the statute my
3 friend was referring to is a requirement that if
4 you sell at least $3,000 worth of these
5 instruments or a retail money order, you're
6 required to collect information and maintain it
7 as the seller.
8 That information, however, is not
9 transmitted to MoneyGram. MoneyGram has a
10 policy it will not accept that information. It
11 will not keep it. So what that means is the
12 issuer, which is the actual holder of the funds
13 here, because it's not the selling bank that
14 holds the money, the day after a transaction
15 takes place, that money is transferred from the
16 selling financial institution to MoneyGram, and
17 it's MoneyGram that holds that -- - that
18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but
19 MoneyGram can -- can -- you can require
20 MoneyGram to ask for that information. I mean,
21 that would -- and that would solve your problem
22 just like that because just like with respect to
23 the others that you say have to be covered and
24 keep the existing or keep the address and
25 purchaser information, MoneyGram would, and then
Heritage Reporting CorporationOfficial
43
1 all of that stuff would escheat to your state
2 rather than Delaware.
3 MR. BRONNI: I think, Your Honor, that
4 the reason why our states have -- have not
5 necessarily done that is because I think
6 Congress really when it passed this statute put
7 its thumb on the scale and suggested that
8 keeping that kind of information and having to
9 maintain that information, which my friend on
10 the other side admitted would be a burden, it --
11 it -- Congress decided that was an unnecessary
12 burden.
13 Now Delaware suggests it would only be
14 an unnecessary burden for low-dollar
15 instruments. But that's not actually what
16 Congress said. What my friend on the other side
17 is referring to are things like floor statements
18 where certain members of Congress expressed a
19 concern that -- that by requiring
20 address-keeping you could affect the utility of
21 these instruments by driving up their cost. And
22 there are floor statements that reflect that for
23 low-dollar instruments.
24 But what Congress actually said, all
25 of Congress in 2501 in the findings of facts,
Heritage Reporting CorporationOfficial
44
1 was not that. Instead, it said address
2 collection and maintenance would be an
3 additional burden that is not justified because
4 most of these instruments are -- are purchased
5 in one's home state. And that --
6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, just to
7 be clear, there's nothing in the law that
8 prevents you from requiring MoneyGram to ask for
9 that information.
10 MR. BRONNI: That -- that's correct,
11 Your Honor. Our states could --
12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And that would
13 give you everything you're looking for here?
14 MR. BRONNI: It would potentially for
15 prospective relief but not necessarily for --
16 for --
17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You -- you --
18 you said in -- in your opening that the
19 difference between the instruments that we know
20 are covered, money orders and -- and traveler's
21 checks and the others, is simply a -- a matter
22 of marketing strategy?
23 MR. BRONNI: Yes, Your Honor.
24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But your
25 friend points out that money orders and
Heritage Reporting CorporationOfficial
45
1 traveler's checks, on the one hand, are low
2 value, high volume, purchased anonymously.
3 On the other hand, the agent and
4 teller's checks are high value or at least not
5 limited generally. They're not anonymous.
6 They're drawn on an existing bank account. And
7 they're signed by the bank.
8 Now that seems to be very different
9 than just a marketing strategy.
10 MR. BRONNI: So, Your Honor, I -- I
11 think what Delaware has described there when
12 it's describing money orders is really one
13 segment of the money order market. I don't
14 think that it's accurately described the money
15 order market certainly as it existed in 1974.
16 So Delaware's own sources that are
17 reproduced in the appendix, for instance, the
18 American Bankers Association report on money
19 orders from the late 1950s or the Compton's
20 Encyclopedia, which is also reproduced in their
21 appendix, they do discuss money orders, yes, as
22 a product that was frequently sold in low-dollar
23 amounts at retailers oftentimes to unbanked
24 customers. Although, again, low-dollar amounts
25 and things like that, there is some quibblings
Heritage Reporting CorporationOfficial
46
1 over that because, as Judge Leval pointed out,
2 going back to 1939, Western Union, in fact, sold
3 money order products denominated up to
4 approximately $3500, which, if we adjust for
5 inflation, is about $25,000 today, so hardly a
6 low-dollar instrument.
7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well --
8 MR. BRONNI: But that --
9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- what was
10 the -- what was the value of the -- typical
11 value of the agent and teller's checks?
12 MR. BRONNI: The -- these products did
13 not exist in -- these specific products did not
14 exist in 1974. So teller's checks is a class of
15 instruments. A traditional teller's check did.
16 But the instruments that MoneyGram labeled --
17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Wait. I'm
18 sorry. Did -- I'm -- I slipped -- they didn't
19 exist in 1974?
20 MR. BRONNI: They -- the MoneyGram
21 products that we are talking about here today,
22 correct, did not exist in 1974.
23 But, if I can return to the -- the
24 distinction about the category of money orders
25 for a moment, they describe them again -- their
Heritage Reporting CorporationOfficial
47
1 sources do describe them oftentimes as low --
2 low-dollar instruments. But those same sources
3 also describe money orders as instruments that
4 were also sold at financial institutions in the
5 1970s without those low-dollar limits and
6 obviously weren't aimed primarily at unbanked
7 customers.
8 So their -- their description of the
9 category of what constituted a money order in
10 1974 is simply not accurate even on their own
11 sources. Yes, they describe one segment of the
12 market, but that's not the entirety of the
13 market.
14 Congress did not say personal money
15 orders or low-dollar money orders. Congress
16 said money orders. And that category in 1974
17 included -- instruments sold at financial
18 institutions, and today the agent check money
19 order, which operates precisely like the
20 instruments at issue here yet is only sold at
21 financial institutions in high-dollar amounts,
22 primarily to banked customers, they admit that's
23 a money order. But it lacks all of the things
24 that they say define what a money order is,
25 except the label.
Heritage Reporting CorporationOfficial
48
1 So this was Justice Thomas's question.
2 If you -- their argument is essentially, if you
3 take the label off, it's no longer a money
4 order, even if you change nothing about the
5 instrument. So a -- a good example of this
6 would be the Western Union example. If Western
7 Union tomorrow made a decision that it was going
8 to relabel its Western Union money order as the
9 "Western Gram," it would be Delaware's position
10 that that's no longer a similar written
11 instrument -- or that's no longer a money order.
12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I -- I -- I
13 guess I'm not quite sure I understand. Do you
14 disagree that the agent checks and the teller's
15 checks are typically, generally, whatever, for
16 significantly higher value than a traveler's
17 check?
18 MR. BRONNI: Just like the agent check
19 money order could be, Your Honor, because it
20 doesn't have a limit. So, yes, they are
21 typically bought in higher amounts, but we don't
22 think that that's -- that's really a substantive
23 --
24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I -- okay.
25 But that is suggesting that as a distinction.
Heritage Reporting CorporationOfficial
49
1 Do you disagree that the agent checks and the
2 teller checks are typically drawn on existing
3 accounts while the traveler's checks are not?
4 MR. BRONNI: Again, because they're
5 bought at financial institutions, people will
6 oftentimes buy them where they do their banking.
7 I agree with that. But their -- the "drawn on"
8 language is -- is not actually correct there.
9 Instead, what you're doing is you're prepaying
10 for an instrument. You may deduct the money
11 from your account, but it's a separate financial
12 instrument. So it's not like an -- an ordinary
13 check, for instance, is drawn on your bank
14 account. These instruments are not drawn on
15 anybody's bank account.
16 JUSTICE KAGAN: If "money order" is as
17 broad as you're saying it is, what's left for
18 "similar instrument"?
19 MR. BRONNI: I -- I think, Your Honor,
20 when -- when Congress uses phrases like "money
21 orders," "traveler's checks" and then follows it
22 by a catch-all, I think what that oftentimes
23 reflects, as this Court has said, is Congress is
24 -- is concerned with covering the field and not
25 leaving any loopholes. So it may very well be
Heritage Reporting CorporationOfficial
50
1 that in 1974 there wasn't a product that existed
2 that wouldn't meet the core definition of what a
3 money order is.
4 JUSTICE KAGAN: It was just like a "in
5 case"?
6 MR. BRONNI: I -- I -- I think --
7 JUSTICE KAGAN: Just in case something
8 comes up or we missed something or whatever?
9 MR. BRONNI: That's one way of looking
10 at it. The other option is it's to ensure -- if
11 you accept Delaware's front-line argument, to
12 ensure that you can't simply change the label on
13 an instrument and have it be something else.
14 JUSTICE KAGAN: Yeah, but it might be,
15 right? I mean, I think that this is the -- the
16 strength of Mr. Katyal's argument, that they
17 were thinking of something called traveler's
18 checks, they had used traveler's checks, and
19 they were thinking of something called money
20 orders, like the prototypical things that the
21 Chief Justice was talking about, they had seen
22 money orders, they had used money orders, and
23 then they said, "you know, maybe there's some
24 stuff that functions in the same way that does
25 pretty much the same thing, that has similar
Heritage Reporting CorporationOfficial
51
1 characteristics, whatever the relevant
2 characteristics are, so we'll put that third
3 thing in, you know, other similar things."
4 So that seems to me a -- a more likely
5 way of drafting. It's like you have a
6 particular product in mind and another
7 particular product in mind, and then you realize
8 that there are products you don't know about
9 that might function in the same way.
10 MR. BRONNI: And that -- that is -- we
11 don't disagree that that's a possibility for
12 what happened here. I just think that the way
13 Congress used the -- when it used the term
14 "money order" in '73, yes, we might now today
15 typically think of -- of an instrument that's
16 sold at a retailer. But the fact is Delaware's
17 own sources describe money orders as instruments
18 sold at financial and non-financial institutions
19 and that did not have low-dollar limits.
20 So I -- I think they are money orders,
21 as Judge Leval said, under any common ordinary
22 understanding, but I agree that, at a minimum,
23 they are certainly similar written instruments
24 because they operate precisely like the
25 instruments that we all agree are money orders.
Heritage Reporting CorporationOfficial
52
1 And if I can address briefly one of
2 the labeling points that I think the -- the
3 other side made, that -- that they pointed out,
4 you know, people -- generally, things are
5 labeled consistent with what you would think
6 they would be. And I think that's right. You
7 know, most -- they can't -- they don't identify
8 another product sold by another institution that
9 works like these.
10 And that's because this is basically a
11 product where money order had a business model
12 of selling money orders, and it didn't want to
13 alter the structure of how it does things. So
14 it -- it put a different label on it and sold it
15 somewhere else in order to appeal to a different
16 end of the market without fundamentally altering
17 the product itself because they still operate
18 exactly like money orders.
19 Just like a retail money order, you --
20 you go in, you -- you prepay for it, you get a
21 written instrument in response. The -- the
22 selling financial institution is merely an agent
23 of MoneyGram. It's not a party to the
24 instrument. It's an agent of MoneyGram. And
25 the -- the day after a transaction takes place,
Heritage Reporting CorporationOfficial
53
1 it forwards the money to MoneyGram. The selling
2 financial institution does.
3 At that point, whether we're talking
4 about their so-called teller's checks or agent
5 checks, that selling financial institution is
6 entirely out of the transaction. It has no more
7 role. That is the same role that Western Union
8 played on classic money orders in the 1970s.
9 JUSTICE ALITO: Can I mention a -- a
10 number of different things and ask you to tell
11 me whether you think they are subject to the
12 FDA?
13 So the first one is a conventional
14 cashier's check or a teller's check issued by a
15 local bank and used to pay its own obligations.
16 MR. BRONNI: I -- so I would say, it's
17 -- under our definition, it doesn't meet our
18 definition of a money order. We have not taken
19 a position necessarily on whether it's a similar
20 written instrument, but I -- I think that there
21 are reasons for believing that it is not
22 because, again, that is not an instrument that
23 would present the windfall problem, as Your
24 Honor framed it.
25 JUSTICE ALITO: And what about a -- a
Heritage Reporting CorporationOfficial
54
1 conventional cashier's check or teller's check
2 issued by a local bank and sold to a bank
3 customer? Same thing?
4 MR. BRONNI: Yeah, again, Your Honor,
5 they would typically keep addresses in -- in --
6 in 1974, certainly, for cashier's checks and
7 classic teller's checks.
8 If I can briefly just add to that,
9 because we've talked about teller's checks a
10 lot, these instruments -- I know I've said this,
11 but to make clear, these instruments are not
12 traditional teller's checks. They label them as
13 teller's checks, but they do not operate like
14 traditional teller's --
15 So a traditional teller's check as it
16 existed in the 1970s was an instrument, yes,
17 signed by a -- a bank officer. They're right
18 about that part, and they stop reading,
19 basically, at that point. But the rest of the
20 definition is a -- signed by a bank officer
21 drawing on funds of his bank at a -- another
22 financial institution.
23 The difference with these items is
24 that's not what's happening here. The -- the
25 signing officer is not drawing on funds of his
Heritage Reporting CorporationOfficial
55
1 own bank anywhere, which also indicates that
2 they -- they don't even meet the definition of
3 "bank check."
4 JUSTICE JACKSON: But are they still
5 viable in the teller's check realm?
6 MR. BRONNI: They -- they -- so there
7 is some jumbling of the record on this point,
8 unfortunately, Your Honor, but I think what
9 Delaware's expert ultimately said is, at most,
10 they might be secondarily liable. But the --
11 the ultimate liability with the so-called
12 teller's check instrument is MoneyGram because
13 MoneyGram is the issuer.
14 JUSTICE ALITO: How about a prepaid
15 cash card? Some grandparents always used to
16 send their grandchildren a MoneyGram -- a
17 MoneyGram for Christmas. And now they want to
18 become more modern, so they send them a prepaid
19 Visa cash card.
20 MR. BRONNI: Not covered either as a
21 money order or a similar written instrument
22 because it has to have a named payee, and gift
23 cards do not have named payees.
24 JUSTICE ALITO: How about a gift
25 certificate that does have a named payee?
Heritage Reporting CorporationOfficial
56
1 MR. BRONNI: A -- a -- I -- I suppose
2 it's -- it's possible if that instrument were a
3 draft. There's not really any record
4 development on this point, that -- that we could
5 quibble about that. And I know that there are
6 some states that do cover instruments like --
7 that have statutes that would cover escheatment
8 for instruments like that.
9 The reason why I'm struggling with
10 that one is I don't know all the characteristics
11 of a gift certificate as opposed to a gift card.
12 JUSTICE KAGAN: You seem to be trying
13 very hard to exclude various kinds of products.
14 Why is that? Why not just say, okay, they're
15 all included, that's good?
16 MR. BRONNI: Well, I -- I think, Your
17 Honor, that when Congress uses -- to -- to go
18 back to the language of the statute, when it
19 says money orders, traveler's checks, or similar
20 written instruments, it's -- it's referring to
21 two things that had -- traveler's checks and
22 money orders that had understandings in 1974
23 that we can rely on.
24 And by using that terminology and
25 using those two instruments as an example, it --
Heritage Reporting CorporationOfficial
57
1 other similar written instruments must share
2 some of those core characteristics of what those
3 two instruments share. So I think Congress
4 decided to limit it.
5 I -- I -- one point of agreement is I
6 think there's -- it -- it's probably true, and
7 the American Bankers Association says this as
8 well, if Congress wanted to include cashier's
9 checks, classic cashier's checks, it probably
10 would have said that. It knew what that
11 instrument was. They were well-known
12 instruments at the time, but they -- they didn't
13 present the windfall problem because, again,
14 addresses were kept typically for cashier's
15 checks just as they are today.
16 JUSTICE BARRETT: I assume that gift
17 cards don't escheat, even if they fall outside
18 of the FDA, as you say, they're not subject to
19 the common law rule of escheat, of -- are they?
20 So that the -- does anyone get them? I thought
21 the reason why stores like them is because a lot
22 of times people don't use them and they just get
23 to keep the money.
24 MR. BRONNI: I -- I think, Your Honor,
25 there's been a development over time in the law
Heritage Reporting CorporationOfficial
58
1 as states have realized that there are these
2 things out there that certain states have passed
3 statutes. I don't believe that all states have,
4 and I think Arkansas does not have such a
5 statute, but I think it's just been a
6 development as these things have become more
7 popular.
8 JUSTICE GORSUCH: Can I ask you a
9 question that kind of goes sideways? At -- at
10 -- at places in your brief, you indicate that
11 you're after not just a declaration of rights
12 here under the Disposition Act, but you actually
13 want money damages for past wrongful takings of
14 monies you think belong to your states.
15 What -- what is the -- what is the
16 cause of action that permits that? Is that an
17 implied cause of action under the Disposition
18 Act? What -- I'm just curious, if -- if -- if
19 we were to agree with you, what happens next and
20 on what theory?
21 MR. BRONNI: So I -- I think it is an
22 implied cause of action under the statute, but I
23 would add that we have not litigated the damages
24 issue or the question, those kinds of arguments
25 haven't been presented to Judge Leval because
Heritage Reporting CorporationOfficial
59
1 the parties agreed to bifurcate the proceedings
2 here. So we haven't addressed any of the
3 damages issues.
4 But, as for things -- I know Delaware
5 discusses in its brief, you know, the -- the
6 possibility that -- that it could need to repay
7 this money. But what I would -- I would
8 highlight is, you know, anytime we're dealing
9 with unclaimed property, the -- the state is
10 essentially holding it in trust.
11 It's not the State of Delaware's
12 money. It's not -- not really our state's
13 money. We hold it in trust for our -- for
14 the -- the -- the true owners. So requiring it
15 to pay that money to the appropriate state which
16 will hold it in trust for the actual owners,
17 Delaware really doesn't have any reliance
18 interest there that would be upset.
19 JUSTICE GORSUCH: But whether there's
20 an -- such an implied cause of action under the
21 Disposition Act would be something that the
22 Special Master would have to resolve after this?
23 MR. BRONNI: For the -- for the
24 damages issue --
25 JUSTICE GORSUCH: Yeah.
Heritage Reporting CorporationOfficial
60
1 MR. BRONNI: -- yes, Your Honor, I
2 think that's something that could be resolved in
3 there.
4 JUSTICE GORSUCH: All right. All
5 right. Thank you. Thank you.
6 MR. BRONNI: There's one other point I
7 wanted to -- or a couple of points I wanted to
8 briefly address. I've -- I mentioned briefly
9 the bank check thing, but I want to make sure I
10 -- I -- I make this clear.
11 You know, Delaware's definition of a
12 third-party bank check, setting aside whether an
13 issuer or processor could be a third party in
14 1974, and it can't for the reasons the experts
15 explain, but these instruments don't even meet
16 Delaware's own definition of a bank check. So
17 Delaware says that in order to be a third-party
18 bank check, something must first be a bank
19 check.
20 As I mentioned earlier when we were
21 discussing teller's checks, a -- a -- a bank
22 check -- and this is -- is really you've only
23 been offered two sort of reasonable readings of
24 what that term meant in the 1970s or even today,
25 one of which I'll call the sort of technical
Heritage Reporting CorporationOfficial
61
1 definition.
2 This is at page 37 of their exceptions
3 where they say that a -- a bank check is an
4 instrument that's signed by a bank officer, and,
5 as I said before, they stopped reading at that
6 point, but it actually says drawing on funds
7 deposited in the officer's own bank, that's a
8 classic cashier's check, or drawing on funds of
9 the officer's bank deposited in another
10 financial institution. That's a classic or
11 traditional teller's check.
12 Again, that does not describe these
13 instruments here. When the bank officer signs,
14 one, he's signing as an agent of MoneyGram. To
15 the extent that's not already obvious as a
16 functional matter, the contracts between
17 MoneyGram and the financial institutions make
18 very clear the financial institution is an agent
19 of MoneyGram.
20 So in -- it doesn't -- there -- these
21 instruments don't meet that definition because
22 it's -- it's not signing to draw on any funds
23 that are in any control of the selling bank.
24 Instead, it's MoneyGram that has the
25 money, and it's MoneyGram that is responsible
Heritage Reporting CorporationOfficial
62
1 for paying the drawee bank or for reporting the
2 unclaimed property.
3 The other definition of bank check
4 that you've been given is a broader definition
5 than that, and it's the -- the definition that
6 Brady's Law of Bank Checks, which is again
7 reproduced in Delaware's appendix, gives for
8 bank checks where it describes a bank check as
9 both those -- that technical definition that I
10 just mentioned but also ordinary checks.
11 Or -- in -- in the 1970s going all the
12 way back until World War I, "bank check" had
13 been used as a terminology -- used as a term
14 under Brady's Law of Bank Checks to both mean
15 those -- those specific instruments issued by
16 banks but also ordinary checks, and that's part
17 of why a third-party bank check ultimately, what
18 that phrase means if we're in the "similar
19 written instrument" provision, is an ordinary
20 check.
21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The impression
22 I got reading your arguments and your friend's
23 argument is that nobody has much of an idea what
24 a third-party bank check is.
25 Is that -- is that a fair --
Heritage Reporting CorporationOfficial
63
1 MR. BRONNI: That's fair, Your Honor.
2 I -- I think that we're --
3 (Laughter.)
4 MR. BRONNI: -- we are -- we are,
5 however, stuck with -- with two things. We have
6 to at least try and figure out what the
7 terminology could have meant using similar
8 phraseology in the 1970s, and, you know, again,
9 it -- they've agreed that it has to at least be
10 a bank check. We're in agreement there.
11 Something must at least be a bank check, and
12 these don't meet that definition.
13 But, in -- in -- in terms of what the
14 entire phrase could have meant, again, you --
15 this is another example where I think you've
16 only been offered two realistic options based in
17 the way similar phraseology was used in the
18 1970s, neither one of which would describe these
19 instruments.
20 So Delaware says that a -- that in the
21 phrase third-party bank check, the third party
22 refers to an outside issuer or payer.
23 The problem with that is that that's
24 not the way "third party" is used on a financial
25 instrument. It wasn't used that way in the
Heritage Reporting CorporationOfficial
64
1 1970s. All the experts agreed on that.
2 Instead, when -- when somebody
3 referred to the third party on a check or third
4 party in a financial instrument, that
5 third-party reference was always a reference to
6 a payee or the party that ultimately got paid on
7 an instrument.
8 So sometimes, for instance, it was
9 used like in the twice endorsed check
10 definition, where a third-party check is a
11 common enough phrase then and today that it's
12 actually defined in Black's Law Dictionary as a
13 twice endorsed check. So the third party on
14 that instrument is the endorsee, the third party
15 to the original transaction who is the -- the
16 payee on that instrument.
17 The other way the phrase third party
18 and check got used in the 1970s was in the
19 context of third-party payment services or
20 third-party services, and there again, the
21 reference was always to the party that
22 ultimately got paid, the payee.
23 So a third-party payment service, as
24 the Hunt Commission explained, but it's not the
25 only example, is a mechanism whereby a deposit
Heritage Reporting CorporationOfficial
65
1 intermediary transfers funds to a third-party
2 payee, a third-party account holder upon the
3 orders of the depositor. So, again, there, the
4 phraseology is used to reference the ultimate
5 payee.
6 It's never been used and Delaware
7 doesn't cite a single source where it was used
8 in the 1970s to refer to an outside issuer or
9 processor. And what that means is they've
10 offered a definition that is no way anchored
11 with the way the terminology was used in the
12 1970s.
13 JUSTICE JACKSON: And don't we also
14 have the legislative history that suggests that
15 the inclusion of third-party bank check was
16 supposed to be a technical or minor change?
17 The thing that is a little concerning
18 to me is that if it is used to exclude
19 instruments that function like money orders,
20 then we're talking about a huge carveout to a
21 statute that was designed to solve the
22 inequitable escheatment problem in a way that
23 doesn't seem technical or minor.
24 MR. BRONNI: That -- I absolutely
25 agree with that, Your Honor, that Treasury, when
Heritage Reporting CorporationOfficial
66
1 it requested this, and it's undisputed, it --
2 yes, it's legislative history in some sense, but
3 it's really drafting history. Nobody disputes
4 that -- that Treasury requested this exception.
5 And Treasury characterized it as a
6 clarifying amendment that was designed to cure
7 an ambiguity in the statute, which suggests that
8 it was -- it was -- it was sort of the -- the
9 narrow change to the statute to make something
10 doubly clear.
11 And I think the -- defining a
12 third-party bank check as an ordinary check
13 really fits that characterization of a
14 clarifying amendment and a narrow sort of
15 belt-and-suspenders approach to make sure that
16 ordinary checks, which obviously do not present
17 the windfall problem because, one, we have
18 addresses because we have account information,
19 right, but also aren't prepaid.
20 So that -- that is entirely consistent
21 with that -- that sort of legislative history.
22 JUSTICE KAGAN: I -- I guess they
23 failed in that endeavor to make things doubly
24 clear.
25 (Laughter.)
Heritage Reporting CorporationOfficial
67
1 MR. BRONNI: I -- well, I -- so the
2 generous version of this, I think, Your Honor,
3 is that -- that the way the -- the phraseology
4 was just sort of used at the time, you know,
5 we're -- we're sitting here 50 years on and, you
6 know, banking regulators have their own
7 terminology, but the -- the thing that I would
8 emphasize is that, you know, third-party payment
9 was, in fact, as -- as pointed out in Arkansas's
10 appendix at 177, so common that The Washington
11 Post said that a third-party payment today means
12 essentially a checking account.
13 So that was ordinary phraseology
14 that -- that maybe has gone by the wayside, but
15 it is phraseology that was used at the time.
16 Unless there are --
17 JUSTICE ALITO: Your argument is that
18 in 1974 everybody would have known what a
19 third-party bank check means? I actually do
20 remember 1974.
21 (Laughter.)
22 MR. BRONNI: I think banking
23 regulators might have known what it meant.
24 Maybe not ordinary people. But --
25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,
Heritage Reporting CorporationOfficial
68
1 counsel.
2 Justice Thomas, anything further?
3 JUSTICE THOMAS: Nothing.
4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Justice Alito?
5 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Do you think we do
6 more harm or less harm if we take the Special
7 Master's suggestion that we decide this case
8 with -- without adopting a firm definition of
9 money order?
10 MR. BRONNI: So I -- I think --
11 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's what he
12 tried to do, correct?
13 MR. BRONNI: Correct. I think, Your
14 Honor, that -- that Judge Leval's approach made
15 sense in that, under any ordinary understanding
16 of the term "money order" as the sources,
17 Delaware's sources -- again, the ABA report on
18 money orders from the late 1950s, the Compton's
19 Encyclopedia define money order. It includes
20 instruments sold by financial institutions, not
21 in low-dollar amounts, and it includes
22 instruments like the agent check money order
23 here.
24 And I think that is the -- when --
25 when Congress adopted the term "money order," it
Heritage Reporting CorporationOfficial
69
1 --
2 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You haven't
3 answered my question.
4 MR. BRONNI: I -- I -- I think that it
5 -- it meets any ordinary definition. So I -- I
6 -- I don't think that it does any harm to define
7 it that way. I know they present -- we started
8 with a parade of horribles, for instance --
9 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Do we do less
10 parade of horribles if we define it your way?
11 Because you take care of cashier's checks and, I
12 presume, certified checks by calling them a
13 prepaid -- a prepaid draft, correct?
14 MR. BRONNI: Correct. I -- the reason
15 why I struggle with this is -- is I think both
16 things are -- are sort of -- neither one does
17 that much harm because, again, they're alluding
18 to this possibility of a parade of horribles,
19 but they don't point to anything that would
20 present that -- that parade of horribles. You
21 know, cashier's checks, even if you --
22 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, you waited
23 how long to sue? They're afraid of all the guys
24 who are going to come after -- come and sue now.
25 And they have good reason to worry because, once
Heritage Reporting CorporationOfficial
70
1 we write a decision, the world will have the
2 roadmap.
3 MR. BRONNI: So what I would say to
4 that, Your Honor, is that -- that at least
5 outside of the context of this case, I'm not
6 aware of a situation where anybody -- they
7 allude, for instance, to private realtors, not
8 to states having brought suits over cashier's
9 checks, and even in those cases, nobody that I'm
10 aware of is arguing that a cashier's check is a
11 money order. Instead, those cases are all about
12 the "similar written instruments" clause.
13 But either way, I don't think that our
14 definition, as I started by saying, necessarily
15 requires treating them that way. I think
16 they're well-known instruments. And if -- if
17 Congress had intended to include them, it
18 probably would have used that language because
19 they were well-known instruments at the time and
20 they just don't fit what Congress describes in
21 2501 as -- as a money order because they're not
22 instruments for which addresses weren't kept as
23 a business practice.
24 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Thank you.
25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Justice Kagan?
Heritage Reporting CorporationOfficial
71
1 Justice Gorsuch? No?
2 Justice Barrett?
3 Justice Jackson?
4 JUSTICE JACKSON: One final question.
5 So Justice Kagan pointed out that
6 Congress might have been intending to cover the
7 field with this statute. And I guess my
8 question is, so what -- what is the field? It
9 seems as though your friend says that really
10 Congress was worried about no addresses, and, as
11 a result, large-money instruments wouldn't fit
12 in the statute because there was an incentive to
13 have addresses.
14 And I understood you to be focusing on
15 Congress's be -- concern about inequitable
16 escheatment, in which case these instruments
17 would be covered. So can you just, as a final
18 word here, talk about what the purpose of this
19 statute is?
20 MR. BRONNI: I -- I -- I -- well, I'll
21 start with the purpose of the statute is to
22 address those instruments that presented the
23 windfall inequity problem associated with the
24 Court's common law rule.
25 I think what they're suggesting is
Heritage Reporting CorporationOfficial
72
1 there would be an incentive to keep addresses
2 for larger-dollar instruments. However, this
3 case is a prime example of that hasn't happened.
4 These are larger-dollar instruments, and
5 MoneyGram does not keep addresses.
6 And it's the -- the -- the point here
7 is that it's the issuer. It's the party that is
8 actually responsible for paying these
9 instruments. It's the party that holds the
10 unclaimed property. And it hasn't kept those --
11 address information. So, I mean, to the extent
12 Delaware's suggesting that that somehow makes a
13 difference here, the record just doesn't bear
14 that out.
15 But, again, going back to the -- the
16 -- the other point about -- you know, Congress's
17 actual concern was not just the low-dollar
18 instruments. Congress's concern was that
19 requiring addresses to be kept for money orders
20 as a class of instruments and other similar
21 written instruments would be an additional
22 burden that is not justified in light of the
23 fact that people buy these instruments where
24 they do their banking. They buy them in their
25 home state.
Heritage Reporting CorporationOfficial
73
1 So, if you required addresses and all
2 the burdens that go along with that, it's simply
3 going to reflect the same place. So what
4 Congress is saying in 2501 is, to use Learned
5 Hand's phrase, the game is not worth the candle
6 here. Congress just decided it was easier just
7 to have these instruments escheat to the state
8 of purchase, regardless of what their value
9 would be.
10 JUSTICE JACKSON: Thank you.
11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,
12 counsel.
13 Rebuttal, Mr. Katyal?
14 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF NEAL K. KATYAL
15 ON BEHALF OF DELAWARE
16 MR. KATYAL: Thank you, Mr. Chief
17 Justice. Five points.
18 First, as the Chief Justice said, they
19 can solve this problem easily by saying
20 MoneyGram has to have the information. The
21 information's already being collected by the
22 banks. The only question is closing that
23 informational hiccup. And that's a lot better,
24 Justice Sotomayor, than the
25 instrument-by-instrument litigation that will be
Heritage Reporting CorporationOfficial
74
1 invited by their approach.
2 His answer to that was -- to say to
3 the Chief Justice, was, well, Congress put its
4 thumb on the scale. They did with respect to
5 those two instruments. The question in this
6 case is, did they do so for anything more than
7 that? And the reasons why Congress isolated
8 those two instruments don't apply here.
9 The other point is Congress is the
10 solution to this. Even if you don't think
11 states will have this easy fix, which I can't
12 understand to this day why they haven't done it,
13 but Congress can, of course, do that. That's
14 what you said in the Delaware case in 1993. If
15 you're worried about equity concerns, Congress
16 should fix it. And what did you point to in
17 that -- in that decision? You literally pointed
18 to 2503 and said that's the solution if you're
19 worried about equity concerns.
20 Second, with respect to third-party
21 banks, my friend says that there's no expert
22 testimony that supports our position. That's a
23 misreading of the record. The expert, Ron Mann,
24 just didn't support our position on the words
25 "directly liable" back down below. As this case
Heritage Reporting CorporationOfficial
75
1 comes to the Court, we agree Professor Mann was
2 wrong with that.
3 But, with the definition of
4 "third-party bank check," I think, Mr. Chief
5 Justice, you said, well, nobody really knows
6 what it means. We actually think the Hunt
7 Commission does know what it means, and they
8 told you what it means in that report, and that
9 says teller's checks are included.
10 Now my friend says -- this is our
11 third point -- that cashier's and certified
12 checks are different. Well, first of all, note
13 that he doesn't necessarily -- he doesn't
14 disclaim them. He says, well, we're not
15 necessarily saying it.
16 There's already litigation about
17 cashier's checks and certified checks, as the
18 ABA brief points out. There have been qui tam
19 lawsuits that have been filed. He says, well,
20 cashier's checks aren't prepaid. Most cashier's
21 and certified checks are prepaid. The only ones
22 that aren't prepaid are the ones in which banks
23 are paying their own expenses, and our brief
24 explains why we think those types of checks are
25 covered under the statute.
Heritage Reporting CorporationOfficial
76
1 Fourth thing, Justice Sotomayor, you
2 -- you had said -- or, excuse me, Justice --
3 Justice Jackson, you had said the question in
4 this case is, what is the field that Congress
5 occupied? Congress knew exactly how to write
6 the statute they want. They had the 1966
7 example. They didn't do that here. They wrote
8 a much more narrow statute.
9 And if you define, Justice Jackson, a
10 money order as anything that transmits money
11 that is prepaid, you blow up the statute. It
12 means you can't explain what "traveler's checks"
13 means. You can't explain what is left for
14 "other similar written instruments." Everything
15 would be a money order. Nothing would be
16 similar to a -- nothing would be similar to it.
17 And that's why Congress -- we think
18 you should look to the rationales behind what
19 Congress did. You pointed to the legislative
20 history and the Treasury Department, but the
21 Treasury Department just says essentially that
22 this is a belt-and-suspenders fix. It doesn't
23 say that -- it doesn't say that -- that -- that
24 -- something like teller's checks, which the
25 Hunt Commission defined as being a third-party
Heritage Reporting CorporationOfficial
77
1 payment system, wouldn't be included.
2 And, finally and last, if you adopt
3 our solution, the common law, it incentivizes
4 exactly the kind of concerns that Justice Alito
5 was worried about in Yee. It avoids any
6 questions about these other instruments, from
7 gift cards to cashier's checks to bearer's bonds
8 and the like, and it avoids threatening the
9 common law primary rule because a primary rule
10 is creditor addresses. And, Justice Thomas,
11 your opinion in Delaware said that has
12 venerable, old roots going all the way back to
13 Old England.
14 If they win, forget about place of
15 incorporation. If they win, the primary rule of
16 the FDA will control, which is to move away from
17 last creditors' addresses. That is something
18 that there has been zero support that my friend
19 has offered on the other side for, and that's
20 why that old presumption that you read statutes
21 to avoid derogation of the common law has
22 special force here.
23 We don't doubt, can you read the
24 statute the way my friend does? You can. But,
25 if you do so, it doesn't make sense of the
Heritage Reporting CorporationOfficial
78
1 statute and threatens all sorts of other
2 financial instruments. And as the ABA says,
3 that's something you should be really, really
4 concerned about in this unique area,
5 particularly because, as Justice Sotomayor
6 points out, this litigation can go all the way
7 back to 1974 and unwind not just the two
8 disputed instruments here but every other
9 financial instrument.
10 The safe thing to do is what you've
11 done in case after case, which is to say, if
12 we're concerned about equity, that's something
13 for Congress. It's something for the states.
14 It's not for this Court.
15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,
16 counsel. The case is submitted.
17 (Whereupon, at 1:02 p.m., the case was
18 submitted.)
