Justice Kagan delivered the opinion of the Court. A recently enacted federal statute establishes a fnancial oversight board within the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico's government. The question presented is whether the statute categorically abrogates (legalspeak for eliminates) any sov- ereign immunity the board enjoys from legal claims. We hold it does not. Under long-settled law, Congress must use unmistakable language to abrogate sovereign immunity. Nothing in the statute creating the board meets that high bar. I Congress passed the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act of (PROMESA), U. S. C. § et seq., to deal with a fscal emergency. Puerto Rico's public debt had soared, to more than the annual output of the island's economy. The Commonwealth could not service that level of debt through the bond markets. And it was not eligible to restructure debt under the Federal Bank- ruptcy Code. PROMESA offered a path out of the crisis, helping Puerto Rico “to achieve fscal responsibility and ac- cess to the capital markets.” § (a). The idea was to set up a system for overseeing Puerto Rico's fnances, while also enabling the Commonwealth to gain bankruptcy protections similar to those available under the Code. See Financial Oversight and Management Bd. for Puerto Rico v. Aurelius Investment, LLC, U. S. –––, ––– – ––– (). PROMESA creates, as its centerpiece, the Financial Over- sight and Management Board for Puerto Rico—the peti- tioner here. The statute describes the seven-member Board as an “entity within the territorial government” of Puerto Rico. § (c)(). And this Court has affrmed that the Board's structure, duties, and powers make it “part of the local Puerto Rican government.” Id., at –––. Under PROMESA, the Board approves and enforces the Common- wealth's fscal plans and budgets, and supervises the Com- Page Proof Pending Publication Page Proof Pending Publication Cite as: U. S. () Opinion of the Court monwealth's borrowing. See §§ –, . The Board also represents Puerto Rico in so-called Title III cases—judicial proceedings, modeled on federal bankruptcy proceedings, for restructuring the Commonwealth's (and its instrumentalities') debt. See §§ –. With one exception, PROMESA says nothing explicit about abrogating sovereign immunity. The exception is for Title III cases, and comes via the Federal Bankruptcy Code. PROMESA incorporates, as part of its mechanism for re- structuring debt, the Code's express abrogation of sovereign immunity. See § (a) (incorporating U. S. C. § for “case[s] under [Title III]”). But as to all other matters PROMESA addresses, Congress did not mention sovereign immunity. In particular, no provision states that it is abrogating any immunity the Board possesses from legal claims. At the same time, several provisions of PROMESA con- template that, even outside the Title III context, the Board may confront legal claims against it. Most fundamentally, Section (a), entitled “Jurisdiction,” states that “any ac- tion against the Oversight Board, and any action otherwise arising out of” PROMESA, “shall be brought” in the Federal District Court sitting in Puerto Rico. And Section (c) anticipates that those actions may lead to orders “granting declaratory or injunctive relief against the Oversight Board”; under the provision, such orders cannot take effect until the litigation is over. On the fipside, PROMESA sets certain limits on litigation targeting the Board. Section forecloses monetary lia- bility against the Board, its members, and its employees for “actions taken to carry out” the statute. And Section (e) provides that no district court will have jurisdic- The section contains two exceptions not relevant here—one for applica- tions to enforce subpoenas, the other for certain actions related to Title III cases. See U. S. C. §§(f)(), (a)(). FINANCIAL OVERSIGHT AND MANAGEMENT BD. FOR P. R. v. CENTRO DE PERIODISMO INVESTIGATIVO, INC. Opinion of the Court tion over challenges to the Board's “certifcation determina- tions”—mainly, decisions approving Puerto Rico's fscal plans and budgets. See §§ (e), (e) (describing those determinations). The suit before us demands that the Board release various documents relating to its work. Respondent Centro de Pe- riodismo Investigativo, Inc. (CPI) is a nonproft media orga- nization that has published many reports on Puerto Rico's fscal crisis and the debt-restructuring process. In , CPI asked the Board to turn over a broad array of materials, including communications between the Board's members and Puerto Rican and U. S. offcials. When the request went unanswered, CPI sued the Board in the Federal District Court in Puerto Rico. CPI cited a provision of the Puerto Rican Constitution interpreted to guarantee a right of access to public records. And it requested an injunction ordering the records' release. The Board moved to dismiss the suit on the ground that, as an arm of the Puerto Rican government, it enjoys sovereign immunity. The District Court denied the motion, reason- ing that Congress had abrogated the Board's immunity in PROMESA—particularly, in Section (a)'s jurisdictional provision. See App. to Pet. for Cert. a–a. While the parties fought over unresolved privilege issues, CPI brought a second suit seeking another set of documents. The Board again invoked sovereign immunity, and the court again de- nied the defense. See id., at a–a. Orders in both suits were consolidated for appeal. The Court of Appeals for the First Circuit affrmed the denial of immunity, over a dissent. See F. th (). The court began by citing Circuit precedent that Puerto Rico (like a State or Indian tribe) enjoys sovereign immunity. It then “assume[d] without deciding” that the Board shares in Puerto Rico's immunity, noting that CPI had not contested that issue. Id., at . That was the Board's fnal piece of Page Proof Pending Publication Cite as: U. S. () Opinion of the Court good news—for the court next held that PROMESA abro- gates the Board's (assumed) immunity. Congress may abro- gate sovereign immunity, the court noted, “by making its intention unmistakably clear in the language of the statute.” Ibid. (quoting Kimel v. Florida Bd. of Regents, U. S. , ()). And Congress had done so, the court held, in Section (a): The “grant of jurisdiction” there “unequivo- cally stated [Congress's] intention that the Board could be sued” in federal district court. F. th, at . The court found additional support for its holding in Sections (c) and (e). The former, the court reasoned, “contemplates” or- ders of “declaratory and injunctive relief” against the Board. Ibid. And the latter, in making certifcation challenges un- reviewable, “implies” that all other claims against the Board fall within Section (a)'s scope. Ibid. Judge Lynch dis- agreed. She would have held that Congress had not ade- quately “set[ ] forth an intent to abrogate” the Board's immu- nity, whether in Section (a)'s jurisdictional grant or in any other provision. Id., at . We granted certiorari, U. S. ––– (), and now reverse. II The question on which we granted certiorari is whether PROMESA—and particularly its jurisdictional provision— abrogates the Board's immunity. See Brief for Oversight Board i. As thus framed, the question asks only about abro- gation, while taking the Board's underlying immunity as a given. That framing accords with how this case played out in the courts below. Because Circuit precedent had settled Puerto Rico's own immunity, the lower courts barely ad- dressed the question. See, e. g., F. th, at –. Simi- larly for the Board's immunity. CPI never argued that the Commonwealth's immunity did not extend to the Board; and for that reason, the courts below simply assumed the Board's immunity before turning to the abrogation issue. See, e. g., Page Proof Pending Publication FINANCIAL OVERSIGHT AND MANAGEMENT BD. FOR P. R. v. CENTRO DE PERIODISMO INVESTIGATIVO, INC. Opinion of the Court id., at –. We took the case on those terms, and we re- solve it on those terms. See, e. g., Cutter v. Wilkinson, U. S. , , n. () (“[W]e are a court of review, not of frst view”). That means we assume without deciding that Puerto Rico is immune from suit in federal district court, and that the Board partakes of that immunity. We address only whether, accepting those premises, PROMESA effects an abrogation. The standard for fnding a congressional abrogation is stringent. Congress, this Court has often held, must make its intent to abrogate sovereign immunity “unmistakably clear in the language of the statute.” E. g., Kimel, U. S., at (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Sossamon v. Texas, U. S. , () (“[W]here a statute is sus- ceptible of multiple plausible interpretations,” we will not read it to strip immunity). We have invoked that clear- statement rule, and applied it equivalently, in cases naming the federal government, States, and Indian tribes as defend- ants. See, e. g., FAA v. Cooper, U. S. , – (); Kimel, U. S., at ; Michigan v. Bay Mills Indian CPI now asks us to extend our review to the underlying immunity issue. CPI still does not contest that the Board shares in whatever immu- nity Puerto Rico possesses. But it argues here that Puerto Rico's immu- nity applies only in its own courts—not in federal courts. See Brief for CPI –. The Government also urges us to address Puerto Rico's im- munity, though to come out the other way: It reads our precedents as supporting immunity in both territorial and federal courts. See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae – (citing, e. g., Porto Rico v. Rosaly y Castillo, U. S. , – ()). We decline the two invitations for the reasons just stated: The proceedings below did not examine those matters, and we agreed to tackle only the abrogation question. Cf. Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority v. Metcalf & Eddy, Inc., U. S. , , n. () (similarly declining to address whether Puerto Rico has sovereign immunity when holding that an order denying immu- nity for one of its instrumentalities is immediately appealable). We also note that this suit—in which Puerto Rico itself plays no role—would be a singularly inapt vehicle to resolve Puerto Rico's immunity. Page Proof Pending Publication Cite as: U. S. () Opinion of the Court Community, U. S. , (). CPI argues that the rule should not likewise apply to Puerto Rico, citing Con- gress's plenary power over Territories. See Brief for CPI – (“The concept of plenary power” is “incompatible with forcing Congress to express its intent unequivocally”). But we have similarly described Congress's power over the tribes, and still demand that Congress “unequivocally ex- press” an intent to abrogate their immunity. Bay Mills, U. S., at (internal quotation marks omitted); see ibid. (“Although Congress has plenary authority over tribes, courts will not lightly assume that Congress in fact intends” to abrogate their immunity). Our precedent thus conveys a consistent message: If a defendant enjoys sovereign immu- nity (which we are assuming the Board does), abrogation requires an “unequivocal declaration” from Congress. Dell- muth v. Muth, U. S. , (). The Court has found that standard met in only two situa- tions. The frst is when a statute says in so many words that it is stripping immunity from a sovereign entity. Con- gress, for example, has provided that States “shall not be immune,” under any “doctrine of sovereign immunity, from suit in Federal court” for patent or copyright infringement. U. S. C. § (a); U. S. C. § (a). Those provisions, we have noted, “could not have made any clearer Congress's in- tent” to abrogate immunity. Allen v. Cooper, U. S. –––, ––– () (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted). The second is when a statute creates a cause of action and authorizes suit against a government on that claim. Take the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) or the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA). We held that each abrogated sovereign immunity by authoriz- ing suits against employers—specifcally including govern- Of course, when the federal government is the defendant, the clear- statement rule operates to identify a waiver of its own immunity, rather than an abrogation of another government's. Page Proof Pending Publication Page Proof Pending Publication FINANCIAL OVERSIGHT AND MANAGEMENT BD. FOR P. R. v. CENTRO DE PERIODISMO INVESTIGATIVO, INC. Opinion of the Court ments—for violating the statute's provisions (i. e., for dis- criminating or denying leave). See Kimel, U. S., at – ; Nevada Dept. of Human Resources v. Hibbs, U. S. , (). Or consider the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA). We likewise saw an abrogation in its authori- zation of tribal suits against States for violating their statu- tory duty to negotiate about gaming compacts. See Semi- nole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, U. S. , – (). True enough, none of those Acts expressly declared sover- eigns non-immune (as the patent and copyright laws did). But all expressly authorized suits against sovereigns in serv- ice of enforcing statutory requirements. And recognizing immunity would have negated those authorizations: The very suits allowed against governments would automatically have been dismissed. PROMESA fts neither of those two molds. Except in Title III debt-restructuring proceedings (not at issue here), the statute does not provide that the Board or Puerto Rico is subject to suit. See supra, at . And indeed, the excep- tion implies the opposite as a general rule. The immunity provision that PROMESA borrows from the Bankruptcy Code for Title III cases states: “[S]overeign immunity is ab- rogated as to a governmental unit,” including a “Territory.” U. S. C. § (a), incorporated by U. S. C. § (a); U. S. C. § (). Congress chose not to adopt similar lan- guage to govern other kinds of litigation involving the Board. See, e. g., Badgerow v. Walters, U. S. –––, ––– () (“When Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same Act, we generally take the choice to be deliberate”). Too, PROMESA does not create any cause of action (or oth- erwise approve any claim) for use against the Board or Puerto Rico. So recognizing immunity under PROMESA would not—as in the ADEA, FMLA, and IGRA cases—au- thorize a suit against a sovereign with one hand, only to bar it with the other. Instead, immunity would operate in the Cite as: U. S. () Opinion of the Court ordinary way—to protect a sovereign from a host of claims Congress has not otherwise said may proceed. The upshot is evident: Congress has not, through a means we have recog- nized, “ma[de] its intention” to abrogate immunity “unmis- takably clear.” Kimel, U. S., at (internal quotation marks omitted). CPI contends we can still find a clear statement in PROMESA, based on the statute's establishment of a judicial review scheme. The primary provision in CPI's argument (as in the First Circuit's, see supra, at ) is Section (a): “[A]ny action against the Oversight Board, and any action otherwise arising out of” PROMESA, “shall be brought” in the Federal District Court for Puerto Rico. In CPI's view, that provision—especially when combined with Section (c)'s allusion to “declaratory or injunctive relief against the Oversight Board”—expresses Congress's “clear intent to subject the Board to suit in federal court.” Brief for CPI . CPI backs up that argument by pointing to provisions insulating the Board (and its members and employees) from monetary liability and barring suits challenging the Board's budgetary decisions. See id., at –, –; see supra, at –. Those protections, CPI maintains, would have no point “if the Board were immune generally.” Brief for CPI . So taken together (says CPI), PROMESA's judicial review provisions are “incompatible with sovereign immu- nity.” Id., at . But all those provisions serve a function without our read- ing an abrogation of immunity into PROMESA. In Sections (a) and (c), Congress indeed contemplated the possibility of suits—and of relief—against the Board. And wisely so— because litigation against the Board can arise even though the Board enjoys sovereign immunity generally. For one thing, statutes other than PROMESA abrogate the Board's immunity from particular claims. See generally supra, at –. Consider Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, prohib- iting various kinds of employment discrimination. That law, Page Proof Pending Publication FINANCIAL OVERSIGHT AND MANAGEMENT BD. FOR P. R. v. CENTRO DE PERIODISMO INVESTIGATIVO, INC. Opinion of the Court this Court has held, validly abrogates the immunity of “gov- ernments” and “governmental agencies” from all actions it authorizes. U. S. C. §§ e(a)–(b); see Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, U. S. , – (). So if a Board employee were fred because of race, Section (a) would tell him where to bring his suit and Section (c) would govern the timing of injunctive and declaratory relief. And for another thing, the Board could decide to waive its immunity from particular suits or claims. Were it to do so, Sections (a) and (c) would again kick in. So PROMESA's judicial review scheme—absent a categorical abrogation of immunity—still has plenty of work to do. For similar reasons, this Court has held that other jurisdictional and judicial review pro- visions were insuffcient to establish an abrogation. See Blatchford v. Native Village of Noatak, U. S. , , and n. (); Dellmuth, U. S., at . Here, as there, providing for a judicial forum does not make the requisite clear statement. Nor do the litigation protections in PROMESA fll the gap. At the most basic level, it would be peculiar to read shields from lawsuits as unmistakably subjecting the Board to law- suits (by abrogating immunity). But aside from that, CPI is wrong to think that those shields would be “pointless” or “superfuous” unless PROMESA generally abrogates the Board's immunity. Brief for CPI . Consider frst Section 's protection of the Board, its employees, and its mem- bers from monetary liability for carrying out PROMESA. That provision would do work whenever, as discussed above, some other law abrogated or waived the Board's immunity from specifc claims. In such a case, the claim could go for- ward, but Section would stop the award of money dam- ages. Of particular note, that section would limit the Board's liability in Title III cases, in which PROMESA has indeed abrogated immunity. See supra, at . And last, Section protects individuals—the Board's members and employees—not covered by the Board's sovereign immu- Page Proof Pending Publication Cite as: U. S. () Thomas, J., dissenting nity. All in all, that seems like more than enough to explain the provision's existence. Similarly for Section (e), which prevents challenges to the Board's fscal and budget- ary decisions. Yes, sovereign immunity insulates the Board itself from those attacks. But without Section (e), a plaintiff might get around that immunity via an Ex parte Young action—a suit against an individual Board member for injunctive relief. See Virginia Offce for Protection and Advocacy v. Stewart, U. S. , – () (describ- ing the Ex parte Young “limit on the sovereign-immunity principle”). Section (e) precludes that possibility. So it too has a role to play in a scheme with sovereign immunity. In short, nothing in PROMESA makes Congress's intent to abrogate the Board's sovereign immunity “unmistakably clear.” Kimel, U. S., at . The statute does not explic- itly strip the Board of immunity. It does not expressly au- thorize the bringing of claims against the Board. And its judicial review provisions and liability protections are com- patible with the Board's generally retaining sovereign immu- nity. We therefore reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case for further proceedings con- sistent with this opinion. It is so ordered. Justice Thomas, dissenting. At every stage of these proceedings, respondent has ar- gued that petitioner lacks state sovereign immunity. Peti- tioner has consistently replied that it has that immunity and that nothing abrogates it. The courts below, bound by Cir- cuit precedent, held that petitioner does have state sovereign immunity—but they also held that the immunity has been abrogated. The Court today disagrees with only that latter conclusion, holding that nothing abrogates petitioner's immu- nity, but it “assume[s] without deciding” the logically ante- cedent question whether petitioner enjoys that immunity in the frst place. Ante, at . In doing so, the majority ef- Page Proof Pending Publication FINANCIAL OVERSIGHT AND MANAGEMENT BD. FOR P. R. v. CENTRO DE PERIODISMO INVESTIGATIVO, INC. Thomas, J., dissenting fectively decides the outcome of this case. Because I would reach the antecedent question and hold that petitioner lacks the only immunity it has ever asserted, I respectfully dissent. Respondent, Centro de Periodismo Investigativo, Inc. (CPI), sued petitioner, the Financial Oversight and Manage- ment Board for Puerto Rico, over a document-disclosure dis- pute. The Board moved to dismiss the lawsuit by invoking state sovereign immunity, which the Board claimed to pos- sess as an arm of the Puerto Rican territorial government. CPI responded (both in the District Court and on appeal) that Puerto Rico has no such immunity and that, even if it did, that immunity would be abrogated by the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act (PROMESA), U. S. C. § et seq. Bound by Circuit precedent holding that Puerto Rico enjoys state sovereign immunity, each court below rejected CPI's frst argument. See F. th , (CA ). But the courts below also agreed with CPI's second argument that the Board's immu- nity was abrogated. When the Board asked us to review that holding, CPI once again raised its lead argument, pointing out that we logically could not reverse the First Circuit's judgment without frst addressing whether the Board actually has the immunity that the Board claims has not been abrogated. And, in its merits brief, CPI made Puerto Rico's lack of state sovereign immunity its lead argument. There is nothing more that CPI could have done to preserve this antecedent, disposi- tive argument. Yet the majority skips it entirely, “assum[ing] without de- ciding that Puerto Rico is immune from suit in federal dis- trict court”—while also deciding that PROMESA does not abrogate that assumed immunity. Ante, at . In doing so, it effectively consigns CPI's case to the dustbin, remand- ing back to a Circuit where Circuit precedent will dictate the outcome. CPI might be forgiven for wondering whether we granted certiorari only insofar as our review would favor the Board. Page Proof Pending Publication Page Proof Pending Publication Cite as: U. S. () Thomas, J., dissenting The majority asserts that it need not address CPI's argu- ment because “[t]he proceedings below did not examine those matters, and we agreed to tackle only the abrogation ques- tion.” Ibid., n. . But it is unclear why the court below would have examined the matter any further, given its prec- edent. And, “[t]his issue is predicate to an intelligent reso- lution of the question presented,” as it makes no sense to analyze whether PROMESA abrogates state sovereign im- munity without frst determining whether that immunity is implicated at all. United States v. Grubbs, U. S. , , n. () (internal quotation marks omitted). Because I think the Court has a duty to pass upon issues that are fairly presented, preserved by the parties, and necessary to sup- port its judgment, I would consider whether the Board has the immunity it asserts. From the start, the Board has asserted only that it pos- sesses what it has called “Eleventh Amendment immunity.” The First Circuit agreed, explaining that it “has long treated Puerto Rico like a state for Eleventh Amendment purposes.” F. th, at . However, the plain text of the Eleventh Amendment applies only to lawsuits brought against a State by citizens of another State. And, because CPI is a resident of Puerto Rico, I can only assume that the Board and the The fact that the First Circuit barely addressed the issue below, simply noting Circuit precedent, is surely irrelevant; we have often granted cer- tiorari on questions that were resolved below with drive-by citations to binding precedent, sometimes in footnotes. See, e. g., App. to Pet. for Cert. in Lora v. United States, O. T. , No. –, p. a, n. ; App. to Pet. for Cert. in Smith v. United States, O. T. , No. –, p. a. We have often recognized the need to address such logically antecedent questions. See, e. g., Caterpillar Inc. v. Lewis, U. S. , , n. (); see also Vance v. Terrazas, U. S. , –, n. () (collecting cases). For example, we explained in Grubbs that it would “mak[e] little sense to address what the Fourth Amendment requires of anticipatory search warrants if it does not allow them at all.” U. S., at , n. . And, in Rumsfeld v. Forum for Academic and Institutional Rights, Inc., U. S. (), we explained that “granting certiorari to determine whether a statute is constitutional fairly includes the question of what that statute says.” Id., at . Page Proof Pending Publication FINANCIAL OVERSIGHT AND MANAGEMENT BD. FOR P. R. v. CENTRO DE PERIODISMO INVESTIGATIVO, INC. Thomas, J., dissenting First Circuit meant to refer to the sovereign immunity that is inherent in the States. See Allen v. Cooper, U. S. –––, ––– (). As we have explained, inherent state sovereign immunity refects the original design of the Constitution. See Fran- chise Tax Bd. of Cal. v. Hyatt, U. S. –––, ––– – ––– (). At the Founding, the “States considered themselves fully sovereign nations,” and part of that sovereignty “was their immunity from private suits.” Id., at ––– (internal quota- tion marks omitted). When advocating for the Constitu- tion's ratifcation, leading Federalists then assured their op- ponents that the Constitution would not allow private citizens to hale States into federal court without their con- sent. See ibid. Though this Court held otherwise soon thereafter in Chisholm v. Georgia, Dall. (), the Eleventh Amendment's swift ratifcation confrmed that Chisholm was wrong. See Hyatt, U. S., at ––– – –––. Thus, in general, the Constitution does not allow federal or state courts to hear cases against States without their con- sent. See id., at ––– – –––; Alden v. Maine, U. S. , – (). This deeply rooted rule “inheres in the sys- tem of federalism” that the Constitution establishes. See id., at . Here, however, all sides agree that Puerto Rico is a Terri- tory, not a State. See Puerto Rico v. Sánchez Valle, U. S. , – (). Accordingly, it is diffcult to see how the same inherent sovereign immunity that the States enjoy in federal court would apply to Puerto Rico. To be sure, the The Court has described this unique form of sovereign immunity as belonging to the original States by dint of their post-Independence and pre-Ratifcation independent sovereignty and to the subsequently ad- mitted States as a result of their admission to the Union on an equal footing with the original States. Alden, U. S., at ; see also Michi- gan v. Bay Mills Indian Community, U. S. , , n. () (Thomas, J., dissenting); accord, Hyatt, U. S., at ––– – ––– (noting unique nature of state sovereign immunity). Cite as: U. S. () Thomas, J., dissenting United States has urged us to hold that Puerto Rico enjoys a form of common-law immunity that, it claims, territorial governments can invoke in federal court. See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae –. But the Board has, at every stage, argued only that it possesses the same immu- nity as States. That argument appears untenable. And, as the party asserting an immunity, the Board should have the burden of establishing its immunity. Because the Board has failed to do so, I would rule in CPI's favor and affrm the judgment below. I respectfully dissent.
