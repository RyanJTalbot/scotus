Page Proof Pending Publication Cite as: U. S. () Opinion of the Court test, and a doctor knows that he did fve tests but submits a claim for ten, then he has knowingly submitted a false claim. But sometimes the rule is less clear. If a law authorized payment for only “customary” medical tests, some doctors might be confused when it came time for billing. And, while some doctors might honestly mistake what that term means, others might correctly understand whatever “customary” meant in this context—and submit claims that were inaccu- rate anyway. The cases before us today involve a legal standard similar to that latter example: In certain circumstances, pharmacies are required to bill Medicare and Medicaid for their “usual and customary” drug prices. And, critically, these cases in- volve defendants (respondents here) who may have correctly understood the relevant standard and submitted inaccurate claims anyway. The question presented is thus whether re- spondents could have the scienter required by the FCA if they correctly understood that standard and thought that their claims were inaccurate. We hold that the answer is yes: What matters for an FCA case is whether the defendant knew the claim was false. Thus, if respondents correctly interpreted the relevant phrase and believed their claims were false, then they could have known their claims were false. I The FCA permits private parties to bring lawsuits in the name of the United States—called qui tam lawsuits—against those who they believe have defrauded the Federal Govern- ment. § (b). Petitioners here brought two such law- suits against respondents, which are companies that operate hundreds of retail drug pharmacies nationwide. In No. – , respondents are a group of companies that we collec- tively call SuperValu; in No. –, respondent is Safeway, Inc. According to petitioners, respondents overcharged Medicare and Medicaid programs for years when seeking re- Page Proof Pending Publication UNITED STATES ex rel. SCHUTTE v. SUPERVALU INC. Opinion of the Court imbursement for prescription drugs that the programs cov- ered. In doing so, petitioners argue, respondents defrauded the Government and violated the FCA. A The claims at issue here relate to two federal benefts pro- grams: Medicaid, which establishes a cooperative federal- state program that provides medical assistance to certain low-income individuals, see U. S. C. § et seq., and Medicare, which provides federally funded health insurance coverage to individuals who are or older or who are dis- abled, see U. S. C. § et seq. As relevant here, States' Medicaid plans may offer outpa- tient prescription-drug coverage to qualifying individuals. § d(a)(). However, the Federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has promulgated regulations that limit the amount these programs may reimburse for cer- tain drugs. See CFR § .(b)() (). Those regu- lations limit any reimbursement to the lower of two amounts, one of which is the healthcare provider's “usual and customary charges [for the drug] to the general public.” Ibid. State Medicaid agencies likewise typically reimburse pharmacies for the lowest of different amounts, one of which is often the pharmacy's “usual and customary charge” to the public. See CMS, Medicaid Covered Outpatient Prescription Drug Reimbursement Information by State, Quarter Ending September (Nov. , ), https://www.medicaid. gov/medicaid/prescription-drugs/state-prescription-drug- resources/medicaid-covered-outpatient-prescription-drug- reimbursement-information-state/index.html. Through Medicare Part D, the Government also offers prescription-drug coverage to benefciaries. See U. S. C. § w– et seq.; CFR pt. . To administer that coverage, CMS awards contracts to private plan sponsors. See U. S. C. § w–; CFR §§ ., .. Those plan sponsors, in turn, enter contracts with pharma- Page Proof Pending Publication Cite as: U. S. () Opinion of the Court cies (sometimes through middlemen called pharmacy beneft managers). Many of the contracts at issue here limited any reimbursement to the pharmacy's “usual and customary” price. The bottom line is that, when respondents submitted reim- bursement claims to these entities, they often were required to charge and disclose their “usual and customary” price for that drug. But, according to petitioners, respondents re- ported higher prices to these entities than the ones that they usually and customarily charged to the public. B According to petitioners, in , respondents' competitor, Walmart, began offering -day supplies of many drugs for $. To compete with Walmart, SuperValu and Safeway adopted price-match programs in which their pharmacies would match a competitor's lower price at a customer's re- quest. SuperValu's pharmacies would then automatically apply that price to future reflls of the drug for those custom- ers. Meanwhile, Safeway also adopted a “membership” dis- count program through which customers received discounted generic drug prices (often $ for a -day supply). To enroll in that membership program, customers had to fll out a form with only basic information; petitioners argue that Safeway often already had this information on fle. SuperValu's pro- grams continued until ; Safeway's continued until . Respondents' discount programs turned out to be popular. Though the exact extent of that popularity is disputed, peti- The FCA covers claims presented both to the Federal Government and to a federal “contractor, grantee, or other recipient” when, as relevant here, the money is “to be spent or used . . . to advance a Government program.” U. S. C. § (b)()(A). Respondents, of course, demur and portray themselves in a far more sympathetic light. We do not resolve any of those factual disputes today, as we resolve only a legal question arising from the grant of summary judgment to respondents. In this posture, we must take the evidence in petitioners' favor. Page Proof Pending Publication UNITED STATES ex rel. SCHUTTE v. SUPERVALU INC. Opinion of the Court tioners have presented evidence that the discounted prices comprised a majority of sales for many drugs to customers who paid in cash (and not through insurance) for at least some years during the programs' operation. For example, according to petitioners, a majority of SuperValu's cash sales for of its top-selling prescription drugs were made at those discounted prices. And, according to peti- tioners, % of Safeway's cash sales for its top ge- neric drugs were at discounted rates. Petitioners contend that those discounted prices were ac- tually respondents' “usual and customary” prices—and that, rather than submitting those lower prices for reimburse- ment, respondents instead reported their higher, non- discounted prices. For example, petitioners have presented evidence that Safeway charged just $ for % of its cash sales for a -day supply of a cholesterol drug between and . Yet Safeway apparently reported prices as high as $ as “usual and customary” during that time. And petitioners presented evidence that, at least at some times and for some drugs, SuperValu made more than % of its cash sales for prices less than what it disclosed as its “usual and customary” price. To be sure, the phrase “usual and customary” on its face appears somewhat open to interpretation. But petitioners contend that respondents were informed that their lower, discounted prices were their “usual and customary” prices, believed their discounted prices were their “usual and cus- tomary” prices, and tried to hide their discounted prices from regulators and contractors. Petitioners have presented evi- dence that they claim supports that theory. For example, both SuperValu and Safeway received a notice in from a pharmacy beneft manager stating that the phrase “usual and customary” refers to discounted prices; Safeway appar- ently received the same message from state Medicaid agen- cies. And executives at both companies raised concerns Page Proof Pending Publication Cite as: U. S. () Opinion of the Court about letting state agencies or pharmacy beneft managers fnd out about their discounted prices. For example, some emails between SuperValu executives described their discount program as a “stealthy approach” and noted concern for the “integrity” of their “U&C price” claims. App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. –, p. a (in- ternal quotation marks omitted). An executive at Safeway similarly stated that “[w]e may have some issues with U&C” and that “if you [match a] price offer, that becomes your usual and customary [price] for that day.” F. th , (CA ) (internal quotation marks omitted). Other documents directed Safeway's employees to match Walmart prices, but cautioned that employees should not “put any of this in writing to stores because our offcial policy is we do not match.” Id., at . Petitioners argue that this and other evidence show that respondents thought that their claims were inaccurate yet submitted them anyway. C Before proceeding, some context about how these cases reached us is useful to understand the question presented. The FCA (as relevant here) imposes liability on those who “knowingly presen[t] . . . a false or fraudulent claim for pay- ment or approval.” § (a)()(A). Thus, two essential el- ements of an FCA violation are () the falsity of the claim and () the defendant's knowledge of the claim's falsity. In SuperValu's case, the District Court ruled against SuperValu on the falsity element—it determined that Super- Valu's discounted prices were its “usual and customary” prices and that, by not reporting them, SuperValu submitted claims that were false. But, the District Court then granted summary judgment for SuperValu based on the scienter ele- ment, holding SuperValu could not have acted “knowingly.” Soon after, it granted Safeway summary judgment on the same basis. Page Proof Pending Publication UNITED STATES ex rel. SCHUTTE v. SUPERVALU INC. Opinion of the Court The Seventh Circuit affrmed. F. th (). In doing so, it relied heavily on Safeco Ins. Co. of America v. Burr, U. S. ()—a case that interpreted the term “ `willfully' ” in the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), id., at . Specifcally, the Seventh Circuit read Safeco to dic- tate a two-step inquiry for ascertaining whether a defendant acted recklessly or knowingly. At step one, the Seventh Circuit took Safeco to ask whether a defendant's acts were consistent with any objectively reasonable interpretation of the relevant law that had not been ruled out by defnitive legal authority or guidance. This step, the Seventh Circuit held, applied regardless of whether the defendant actually believed such an interpretation at the time of its claims. Only if the defendant's acts were not consistent with any objectively reasonable interpretation would the court pro- ceed, at step two, to consider the defendant's actual subjec- tive thoughts. Thus, under the Seventh Circuit's approach, a claim would have to be objectively unreasonable, as a legal matter, before a defendant could be held liable for “know- ingly” submitting a false claim, no matter what the defend- ant thought. Turning to the facts here, the Seventh Circuit held that respondents were entitled to summary judgment because their actions were consistent with an objectively reasonable interpretation of the phrase “usual and customary.” Spe- cifcally, the court reasoned that the phrase could have been understood as referring to respondents' retail prices, not their discounted prices—even if the phrase, correctly under- stood, referred to their discounted prices. It thus did not matter whether respondents thought that their discounted prices were actually their “usual and customary” prices. What mattered, instead, was that someone else, standing in respondents' shoes, may have reasonably thought that the retail prices were what counted. We granted certiorari, see U. S. ––– (), to resolve that legal question: If respondents' claims were false and Page Proof Pending Publication Cite as: U. S. () Opinion of the Court they actually thought that their claims were false—because they believed that their reported prices were not actually their “usual and customary” prices—then would they have “knowingly” submitted a false claim within the FCA's mean- ing? Or is the Seventh Circuit correct—that respondents could not have “knowingly” submitted a false claim unless no hypothetical, reasonable person could have thought that their reported prices were their “usual and customary” prices? It is equally important to recognize what we did not grant certiorari to review: We are not reviewing the meaning of the phrase “usual and customary” or whether any of respond- ents' claims were, in fact, inaccurate or otherwise false. Nor are we reviewing whether respondents actually thought that the phrase “usual and customary” referred to their dis- counted prices. Nor, for that matter, are we reviewing any factual disputes about what respondents did or did not be- lieve or do. These cases come to us from the grant of sum- mary judgment to respondents on one discrete legal issue, and we granted certiorari to resolve only that issue. II Based on the FCA's statutory text and its common-law roots, the answer to the question presented is straightfor- ward: The FCA's scienter element refers to respondents' knowledge and subjective beliefs—not to what an objectively reasonable person may have known or believed. And, even though the phrase “usual and customary” may be ambiguous on its face, such facial ambiguity alone is not suffcient to preclude a fnding that respondents knew their claims were false. A We start, as always, with the text of the FCA. See Uni- versal Health Services, Inc. v. United States ex rel. Escobar, U. S. , (). Here, the FCA defnes the term “knowingly” as encompassing three mental states: First, Page Proof Pending Publication UNITED STATES ex rel. SCHUTTE v. SUPERVALU INC. Opinion of the Court that the person “has actual knowledge of the information,” § (b)()(A)(i). Second, that the person “acts in deliber- ate ignorance of the truth or falsity of the information,” § (b)()(A)(ii). And, third, that the person “acts in reck- less disregard of the truth or falsity of the information,” § (b)()(A)(iii). In short, either actual knowledge, delib- erate ignorance, or recklessness will suffce. That three-part test largely tracks the traditional common-law scienter requirement for claims of fraud. See Restatement (Second) of Torts § (); Restatement (Third) of Torts: Liability for Economic Harm § (). For example, one widely cited English decision, Derry v. Peek, [] App. Cas., articulated the rule as follows: “[F]raud is proved when it is shewn that a false representa- tion has been made () knowingly, or () without belief in its truth, or () recklessly, careless whether it be true or false.” Id., at (judgment of Lord Herschell). And, capturing the FCA's use of the term “deliberate ignorance,” that deci- sion noted that an action for fraud would lie if “a person making a false statement had shut his eyes to the facts, or purposely abstained from inquiring into them.” Id., at . Those standards have been cited and widely adopted by American courts in the century since. See D. Dobbs, P. Hayden, & E. Bublick, Law of Torts § , p. (d ed. ) (Dobbs); Restatement (Second) of Torts, App. § , Reporter's Note. That the text of the FCA tracks the common law is unsur- prising because, as we have recognized, the FCA is largely a fraud statute. See Escobar, U. S., at –, and n. . Indeed, the FCA was frst enacted in to “ `sto[p] the massive frauds perpetrated by large contractors during the Civil War.' ” Id., at . To this day, the FCA refers to “ `false or fraudulent' ” claims, pointing directly to “the common-law meaning of fraud.” Id., at (emphasis The FCA also specifes that the term “ `knowingly' . . . require[s] no proof of specifc intent to defraud.” § (b)()(B). Page Proof Pending Publication Cite as: U. S. () Opinion of the Court added). In the absence of statutory text to the contrary, we would assume that “ `Congress intends to incorporate the well-settled meaning' ” of such a common-law term. See ibid. And here, the FCA's defnition of “knowingly” con- frms that assumption by largely tracking the common-law scienter standards for fraud. On their face and at common law, the FCA's standards focus primarily on what respondents thought and believed. First, the term “actual knowledge” refers to whether a per- son is “aware of” information. See Intel Corp. Investment Policy Comm. v. Sulyma, U. S. –––, ––– – ––– (); Es- cobar, U. S., at (“A defendant can have `actual knowl- edge' that a condition is material without the Government expressly calling it a condition of payment”); Black's Law Dictionary (th ed. ) (“to understand,” or “the per- ception of the truth”); Restatement (Second) of Torts § , and Comment c. Second, the term “deliberate ignorance” encompasses defendants who are aware of a substantial risk that their statements are false, but intentionally avoid tak- ing steps to confrm the statement's truth or falsity. See Global-Tech Appliances, Inc. v. SEB S. A., U. S. , (); Black's Law Dictionary, at (“[v]oluntary igno- rance”); Derry, App. Cas., at . And, third, the term “reckless disregard” similarly captures defendants who are conscious of a substantial and unjustifable risk that their claims are false, but submit the claims anyway. See Black's Law Dictionary, at ; Farmer v. Brennan, U. S. , (); Restatement (Third) of Torts § , Comment c. Respondents contend that “information” can refer only to purely fac- tual information, like the number of drugs sold. But the defnition of “information” is broad, referring to all “knowledge obtained from investi- gation, study, or instruction.” See Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary (); see also American Heritage Dictionary – (). And, in this context, the scienter requirement of the FCA is plainly directed to the falsity of the claims submitted. § (a)()(A). In some civil contexts, a defendant may be called “reckless” for acting in the face of an unjustifably high risk of illegality that was so obvious that it should have been known, even if the defendant was not actually Page Proof Pending Publication UNITED STATES ex rel. SCHUTTE v. SUPERVALU INC. Opinion of the Court Again, that tracks traditional common-law fraud, which or- dinarily “depends on a subjective test” and the defendant's “culpable state of mind.” Id., § , Comment a. What typi- cally matters at common law is whether the defendant made the false statement “without belief in its truth or recklessly, careless of whether it is true or false.” Restatement (Sec- ond) of Torts § , Comment e. If a defendant knows that he “lack[s an] honest belief” in the statement's truth, that is often enough to establish scienter for fraud. Id., Comment d; Dobbs § , at . Both the text and the common law also point to what the defendant thought when submitting the false claim—not what the defendant may have thought after submitting it. As noted above, the text encompasses those who “knowingly presen[t] . . . a false or fraudulent claim”; the term “know- ingly” thus modifes present-tense verbs like “presents.” § (a)()(A). As such, the focus is not, as respondents would have it, on post hoc interpretations that might have rendered their claims accurate. It is instead on what the defendant knew when presenting the claim. See also Re- statement (Second) of Torts § , Comment e (“It is enough that being conscious that he has neither knowledge nor belief in the existence of the matter he chooses to assert it as a fact”); accord, Halo Electronics, Inc. v. Pulse Electronics, Inc., U. S. , () (“[C]ulpability is generally measured against the knowledge of the actor at the time of the challenged conduct”). B The diffculty here, however, is that the phrase “usual and customary” is, on its face, less than perfectly clear. We as- sume (as the District Court ruled in SuperValu's case) that conscious of that risk. See Farmer, U. S., at –. We need not consider how (or whether) that objective form of “recklessness” relates to the FCA today because, as noted above, it is enough to say that the FCA's standards can be satisfed by a defendant's subjective awareness of the claim's falsity or an unjustifable risk of such falsity. Page Proof Pending Publication Cite as: U. S. () Opinion of the Court respondents' “usual and customary” prices were their dis- counted ones; if so, it might have been a forgivable mistake if respondents had honestly read the phrase as referring to retail prices, not discounted prices. But the Seventh Circuit did not hold that respondents made an honest mistake; it held that, because other people might make an honest mistake, defendants' subjective beliefs became irrelevant to their sci- enter. Respondents make three main arguments in support of that rule. But none is persuasive. Respondents frst focus on the inherent ambiguity of the phrase at issue here, asserting that they could not have “known” that their claims were inaccurate because they could not have “known” what the phrase “usual and custom- ary” actually meant. The most that is possible, respondents posit, is that they took a (correct) guess. We disagree. Although the terms, in isolation, may have been somewhat ambiguous, that ambiguity does not preclude respondents from having learned their correct meaning—or, at least, becoming aware of a substantial likelihood of the terms' correct meaning. To illustrate why, consider a hypo- thetical driver who sees a road sign that says “Drive Only Reasonable Speeds.” That driver, without any more infor- mation, might have no way of knowing what speeds are rea- sonable and what speeds are too fast. But then assume that the same driver was informed earlier in the day by a police offcer that speeds over mph are unreasonable and then noticed that all the other cars around him are going only mph. In that case, the driver might know that “Reasonable Speeds” are anything under mph; or, at the least, he might be aware of an unjustifably high risk that anything over mph is unreasonable. Indeed, if the same police offcer later pulled the driver over, we imagine that he would be hard pressed to argue that some other person might have under- stood the sign to allow driving at mph. The same analy- Page Proof Pending Publication UNITED STATES ex rel. SCHUTTE v. SUPERVALU INC. Opinion of the Court sis applies here. According to petitioners, respondents re- ceived notice that the phrase “usual and customary” referred to their discounted prices (in some cases, it seems, from the same entities to which they reported their prices). And, ac- cording to petitioners, respondents comprehended those no- tices and then tried to hide their discounted prices. If that is true, then perhaps respondents actually knew what the phrase meant; or perhaps respondents were aware of an un- justifably high risk that the phrase referred to their dis- counted prices. And, if that is true, then respondents may have known that their claims were false. The facial ambigu- ity of the phrase thus does not by itself preclude a fnding of scienter under the FCA. Second, like the Seventh Circuit, respondents rely on Safeco. They contend that Safeco already interpreted the common-law defnitions of “knowing” and “reckless” and that it did so by looking frst at whether the defendant's “reading of the statute” was “objectively unreasonable.” U. S., at . Accordingly, respondents conclude that, because the FCA has the same common-law terms, it should be read with the same, objective common-law focus. This argument fails twice over. First, Safeco interpreted a different statute, the FCRA, which had a different mens rea standard, “ `willfully.' ” Id., at (quoting U. S. C. § n(a)). While Safeco did reference the common law's standards for “knowing” and “reckless” conduct, see U. S., at –, –, its interpretation was ultimately tied to the FCRA's particular text. To take Safeco as establish- ing categorical rules for those terms would accordingly “abandon the care we have traditionally taken to construe such words in their particular statutory context.” Jerman v. Carlisle, McNellie, Rini, Kramer & Ulrich, L. P. A., U. S. , (). And, as explained above, the FCA's scienter standards are plainly satisfed by a defendant's con- scious belief that his claims are false. Page Proof Pending Publication Cite as: U. S. () Opinion of the Court Second, Safeco did not purport to set forth the purely ob- jective safe harbor that respondents invoke. To the con- trary, Safeco stated that a person is reckless if he acts “knowing or having reason to know of facts which would lead a reasonable man to realize” that his actions were substan- tially risky. U. S., at (emphasis added; internal quo- tation marks omitted). Or, as Safeco alternatively put it, the common law of recklessness contained an objective standard because it encompassed actions involving “an un- justifably high risk of harm that is either known or so obvi- ous that it should be known.” Id., at (emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted); see also Restatement (Second) of Torts § , Comment a () (“Recklessness may consist of either of two different types of conduct. In one the actor knows . . . of facts which create a high degree of risk”). Thus, as we have stated previously, “[n]othing in Safeco suggests that we should look to facts that the defend- ant neither knew nor had reason to know at the time he acted.” Halo Electronics, U. S., at . By a similar token here, we do not look to legal interpretations that re- spondents did not believe or have reason to believe at the time they submitted their claims. Respondents make one more argument, approaching the issue from a somewhat different angle. They contend that, at common law, their claims would not be actionable as fraud- ulent even if their reported prices were not accurate under the correct meaning of “usual and customary.” Their argu- Respondents read a footnote in Safeco to establish the sort of purely objective safe harbor for which they argue. See Safeco, U. S., at , n. . But that footnote—even if it does deem subjective intent to be irrelevant in the FCRA context—certainly was not meant to establish the general rule for the terms “knowing” or “reckless” in all contexts. Cf. Halo Electronics, U. S., at , n. (distinguishing the footnote in the patent-infringement context). Page Proof Pending Publication UNITED STATES ex rel. SCHUTTE v. SUPERVALU INC. Opinion of the Court ment is as follows: At common law, misrepresentations of law are not actionable; only misrepresentations of fact are. Be- cause the FCA incorporates the common law of fraud, it em- bodies that same limitation. And the claims here would have been knowingly false only because respondents cor- rectly understood what “usual and customary” meant. Therefore, respondents conclude, their reports were not false because of any misrepresentation of fact; to the contrary, their claims would have been false only because of their view of the law. But those premises do not support that conclusion. To be sure, many courts appear to have stated—as a general rule— that misrepresentations of law are not actionable at common law. See Restatement (Second) of Torts § ; W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R. Keeton, & D. Owen, Prosser and Keeton on Law of Torts § , pp. – (th ed. ) (Prosser & Keeton). So, for example, if a defendant had told the plain- tiff, “your claim will be dismissed because federal courts lack jurisdiction over claims like that,” that representation might not be actionable as a fraud. See ibid.; Utah Power & Light Co. v. Federal Ins. Co., F. d , (CA ). Varying rationales appear to have been given for this rule, including that such statements are of mere opinion and that no one could justifably rely on them. See Dobbs § , at . For purposes of these cases, we assume without deciding that the FCA incorporates some version of this rule; even then, the rule has signifcant limits on its own terms. As relevant here, statements involving some legal analysis re- main actionable if they “carry with [them] by implication” an assertion about “facts that justify” the speaker's statement. Restatement (Second) of Torts § , Comment c; see also Prosser & Keeton § , at . So, as a contrasting exam- ple, a person might be liable for falsely stating that “the plumbing work that I did on your house complied with state law.” See Sorenson v. Gardner, Ore. , , P. d Page Proof Pending Publication Cite as: U. S. () Opinion of the Court , (). That is because such a statement says something about both the correct meaning of building codes and the facts about the home's construction. Ibid.; see also Hoyt Properties, Inc. v. Production Resource Group, L. L. C., N. W. d , (Minn. ). And homeown- ers might justifably rely on that latter representation about the facts, which thus could be actionable as fraud. Respondents' disclosures here sound more like our hypo- thetical plumber, not our hypothetical legal advisor. Rather than saying, “this is what `usual and customary' means,” re- spondents essentially said, “this is what our `usual and cus- tomary' prices are.” In doing so, they plainly implied facts about their prices that were not known to the plan sponsors, pharmacy beneft managers, and state Medicaid agencies that received their claims. Petitioners' cases thus make out a valid fraud theory even under respondents' common-law rule. * * * Under the FCA, petitioners may establish scienter by showing that respondents () actually knew that their re- ported prices were not their “usual and customary” prices when they reported those prices, () were aware of a sub- stantial risk that their higher, retail prices were not their “usual and customary” prices and intentionally avoided learning whether their reports were accurate, or () were aware of such a substantial and unjustifable risk but submit- ted the claims anyway. § (b)()(A). If petitioners can make that showing, then it does not matter whether some other, objectively reasonable interpretation of “usual and customary” would point to respondents' higher prices. For scienter, it is enough if respondents believed that their claims were not accurate. We need not address any of the other factual or legal dis- putes involved in these cases, including whether petitioners have made a showing suffcient under the correct legal stand- ard to preclude summary judgment. Nor do we need to ad- Page Proof Pending Publication UNITED STATES ex rel. SCHUTTE v. SUPERVALU INC.
