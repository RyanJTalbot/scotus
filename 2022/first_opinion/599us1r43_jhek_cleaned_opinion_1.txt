distinctive concerns for comity and discerning congressional meaning. Indeed, petitioners' approach generates results counter to comity and far afeld from any reasonable interpretation of what qualifes as a do- mestic application of § (c). Consider two U. S. businesses targeted by racketeering activity, one owned by a U. S. resident and one owned by someone living abroad. There is no evidence that Congress in- tended that only the former business owner can bring a § (c) suit, especially since doing so runs the risk of generating international dis- cord. Finally, petitioners argue that a contextual approach is unwork- able because it does not provide a bright-line rule. Such concerns about a fact-intensive test cannot displace congressional policy choices, where a more nuanced test is true to the statute's meaning. Pp. –. F. th , affrmed and remanded.

S. C. §§ –. The District Court dismissed the complaint after concluding that Smagin had failed to allege a “domestic injury,” as required by RJR Nabisco, Inc. v. European Community, U. S. , (). The Ninth Circuit reversed, concluding that Smagin had alleged a domestic injury. This Court agrees with the Ninth Circuit. I A The essential facts as alleged by Smagin are as follows. From to , Yegiazaryan committed fraud against Smagin, stealing his shares in a joint real estate venture in Moscow. To avoid a Russian criminal indictment for that fraud, Yegiazaryan fed to a mansion in Beverly Hills in , where he has lived ever since. In , Smagin, who lives in Russia, won an arbitration award in London against Yegi- azaryan for the misappropriation of his real estate invest- ment (London Award). Yegiazaryan refused to pay that award, which is over $ million. Seeking to collect, Smagin fled an enforcement action in the Central District of California to confrm and enforce the London Award under the Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, June , , U. S. T. , T. I. A. S. No. , as implemented by U. S. C. §§ –. The District Court issued a temporary protective order, followed by a preliminary injunction, freez- ing Yegiazaryan's California assets. In his application for injunctive relief, Smagin informed the District Court that Yegiazaryan had been granted a sub- stantial arbitration award in an unrelated proceeding involv- ing Yegiazaryan and yet another Russian businessman, Su- leymon Kerimov (Kerimov Award). At the time, no funds had yet been paid to Yegiazaryan in satisfaction of that Page Proof Pending Publication YEGIAZARYAN v. SMAGIN Opinion of the Court award, but Smagin was concerned that when they were paid, Yegiazaryan would take steps to transfer the money out of Smagin's reach. Smagin's concerns were justifed. In May , Yegiazar- yan received a $ million settlement in satisfaction of the Kerimov Award. To avoid the District Court's asset freeze, Yegiazaryan accepted the money through the London offce of an American law frm headquartered in Los Angeles. Ye- giazaryan then created “a complex web of offshore entities to conceal the funds,” App. a, and ultimately transferred the funds to a bank account with petitioner CMB Monaco. Yegiazaryan also directed those in his inner circle to fle fraudulent claims against him in foreign jurisdictions, which he would not oppose, in an attempt to obtain sham judg- ments that would encumber the $ million, thereby block- ing Smagin's access to it. Around the same time, Yegiazaryan was hiding his assets in the United States through a system of “shell companies” owned by family members. Id., at a. This included a Ne- vada company, which was owned by his brother and created “for the purpose of sheltering [Yegiazaryan's] U. S. assets from his creditors,” including Smagin. Id., at a. Smagin did not learn about the $ million settlement, Yegiazaryan's efforts to hide it, or the U. S. shell companies until February , when Smagin was granted leave to in- tervene in Yegiazaryan's California divorce proceedings. The next month, the California District Court in the London Award enforcement action granted Smagin's motion for sum- mary judgment on his petition for confrmation of the Award and entered judgment against Yegiazaryan for $ million, including interest. The court also issued several postjudg- ment orders barring Yegiazaryan and those acting at his di- rection from preventing collection on the judgment. For failing to comply with those orders, the District Court subsequently found Yegiazaryan in contempt of court. To avoid having to comply with the contempt order, however, Page Proof Pending Publication Cite as: U. S. () Opinion of the Court Yegiazaryan falsely claimed he was too ill, and submitted a forged doctor's note to the District Court. When Smagin notifed Yegiazaryan that he would be seeking to depose the doctor in question, who resides in California, Yegiazaryan used “intimidation, threats, or corrupt persuasion,” id., at a, to get the doctor to avoid service of the subpoena. B At issue here is a civil RICO suit that Smagin brought in based on the allegations just described. RICO pro- vides a private right of action to “[a]ny person injured in his business or property by reason of a violation of” RICO's substantive provisions. U. S. C. § (c). Invoking that cause of action, Smagin sued Yegiazaryan and CMB Bank (the two petitioners here), as well as other defendants, in the Central District of California. The complaint as- serts two claims against each: a substantive RICO viola- tion, § (c), and a RICO conspiracy claim, § (d). The thrust of Smagin's allegations is that the defendants worked together under Yegiazaryan's direction to frustrate Smagin's collection on the California judgment through a pattern of wire fraud and other RICO predicate racketeering acts, in- cluding witness tampering and obstruction of justice. For these violations, Smagin seeks not only actual damages “no less than $ million,” App. a, but also attorney's fees and treble damages as authorized under RICO. See § (c). Only Yegiazaryan and CMB Bank petitioned for this Court's review. The other defendants include three family members (Suren Yegiazaryan, Artem Yegiazaryan, and Stephan Yegiazaryan); an alleged Russian accom- plice (Vitaly Gogokhia); French, Russian, and Luxembourger individuals who have been administrators of the trust holding the $ million (Na- talia Dozortseva, Murielle Jouniaux, and Alexis Gaston Thielen); an alleg- edly corrupt Russian bankruptcy offcer (Ratnikov Evgeny Nikolaevich); and a registered company hired by Yegiazaryan (Prestige Trust Company, Ltd.) and its U. S. lawyer (H. Edward Ryals). Page Proof Pending Publication YEGIAZARYAN v. SMAGIN Opinion of the Court The District Court dismissed the complaint on the ground that Smagin had “fail[ed] to adequately plead a domestic in- jury,” id., at a, as required by this Court's decision in RJR Nabisco. See U. S., at (“A private RICO plaintiff therefore must allege and prove a domestic injury to its busi- ness or property”). The District Court “place[d] great weight on the fact that Smagin is a resident and citizen of Russia and therefore experiences the loss from his inability to collect on his judgment in Russia.” App. a (internal quo- tation marks and alterations omitted). The Ninth Circuit reversed. It rejected petitioners' invi- tation to follow the domestic-injury approach of the Seventh Circuit, “which has adopted a rigid, residency-based test for domestic injuries involving intangible property,” such as a judgment. F. th , , () (citing Armada (Sing.) PTE Ltd. v. Amcol Int'l Corp., F. d ()). Under the Seventh Circuit's rule, which locates an injury to intangible property at the plaintiff's residence, Smagin could not allege a domestic injury because he resides in Russia. See Armada, F. d, at . The Ninth Circuit instead adopted a “context-specifc” approach to the domestic-injury inquiry, which it found consistent with the approaches of the Second and Third Circuits. F. th, at –; see Bas- cuñán v. Elsaca, F. d , (CA ); Humphrey v. GlaxoSmithKline PLC, F. d , (CA ). Applying that approach, the Ninth Circuit concluded that Smagin had pleaded a domestic injury because he had al- leged that his efforts to execute on a California judgment in California against a California resident were foiled by a pattern of racketeering activity that largely “occurred in, or was targeted at, California” and was “designed to subvert” enforcement of the judgment in California. F. th, at –. This Court granted certiorari to resolve the Circuit split. U. S. ––– (). Because a context-specifc inquiry is Page Proof Pending Publication Cite as: U. S. () Opinion of the Court most consistent with this Court's decision in RJR Nabisco, and because the context here makes clear Smagin has al- leged a domestic injury, the Court affrms. II A The “domestic-injury” requirement for private civil RICO suits stems from this Court's decision in RJR Nabisco. There, the question before the Court was whether RICO applies extraterritorially. To answer that question, the Court employed the presumption against extraterritoriality, which “represents a canon of construction, or a presumption about a statute's meaning, rather than a limit upon Con- gress's power to legislate.” Morrison v. National Austra- lia Bank Ltd., U. S. , (). The presumption provides that “[a]bsent clearly expressed congressional in- tent to the contrary, federal laws will be construed to have only domestic application.” RJR Nabisco, U. S., at . Dual rationales support the presumption against extrater- ritoriality. On the one hand, it refects concerns of interna- tional comity insofar as it “ `serves to protect against unin- tended clashes between our laws and those of other nations which could result in international discord.' ” Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum Co., U. S. , () (quot- ing EEOC v. Arabian American Oil Co., U. S. , ()). On the other hand, the presumption is informed by “the commonsense notion that Congress generally legislates with domestic concerns in mind.” Smith v. United States, U. S. , , n. (). In fact, consistent application of the presumption “preserv[es] a stable background against which Congress can legislate with predictable effects.” Morrison, U. S., at . RJR Nabisco distilled the presumption against extraterri- toriality into two steps. The frst asks “whether the statute gives a clear, affrmative indication that it applies extraterri- Page Proof Pending Publication YEGIAZARYAN v. SMAGIN Opinion of the Court torially.” U. S., at . If the answer is “yes,” then the presumption is rebutted, obviating any need to proceed to step two. If the presumption is not rebutted, however, then step two asks whether the case involves a domestic applica- tion of the statute, which is assessed “by looking to the stat- ute's `focus.' ” Ibid. Applying this framework, the Court assessed the extrater- ritoriality of two of RICO's substantive provisions and, as relevant here, its private cause of action. As to the substan- tive provisions, the Court held at step one that they apply extraterritorially to the same extent that RICO's predicates do, making it unnecessary to proceed to step two. Id., at . Regarding RICO's private right of action, § (c), however, the Court's conclusion was different. The Court determined that § (c) does not overcome the presumption at step one because there is no “clear indication that Con- gress intended to create a private right of action for injuries suffered outside of the United States.” Id., at . “If any- thing,” the Court reasoned, by “cabining” the private cause of action to “injur[ies] to `business or property,' ” “Congress signaled that the civil remedy is not coextensive with § 's substantive prohibitions.” Id., at . Accordingly, in ref- erence to step two, the Court held that “[a] private RICO plaintiff . . . must allege and prove a domestic injury to its business or property.” Id., at . In announcing this “domestic-injury” requirement, the Court did not have occasion to explain what constitutes a “domestic-injury,” because the plaintiffs in RJR Nabisco had stipulated that they were not seeking redress for domestic injuries. Id., at . The question now before the Court is whether Smagin has alleged a domestic injury. “While `it will usually be preferable' to begin with step one, courts have the discretion to begin at step two `in appropriate cases.' ” Western- Geco LLC v. ION Geophysical Corp., U. S. –––, ––– () (citing RJR Nabisco, U. S., at , n. ). Page Proof Pending Publication Cite as: U. S. () Opinion of the Court B The parties advance competing approaches to the domestic injury inquiry. Petitioners urge the Court to adopt a bright-line rule, akin to the Seventh Circuit's, that locates a plaintiff's injury at the plaintiff's residence. Petitioners advance two different versions of this rule. As their primary position, petitioners argue that any in- jury cognizable under § (c) is necessarily suffered at the plaintiff's residence because “the private cause of action remedies only economic injuries, and a plaintiff necessarily suffers that injury at its residence” where the economic in- jury is felt. Brief for Petitioners . In the alternative, petitioners argue that, at least when the alleged injury in- volves intangible property, such as the judgment here, rele- vant common-law principles locate the intangible property at the plaintiff's place of residence, such that the injury is also located there. Id., at –, –. On either version of petitioners' rule, Smagin cannot allege a domestic injury because he lives in Russia. Smagin, in contrast, defends a contextual approach that considers all case-specifc facts bearing on where the injury “arises,” not just where it is “felt.” Brief for Respondent . In the context of this suit, Smagin argues that he has stated a domestic injury because he has alleged that he was injured in his ability to enforce a California judgment, against a Cali- fornia resident, through racketeering acts that were largely “designed and carried out in California” and were “targeted at California.” Id., at , . C The Court agrees with Smagin and the Ninth Circuit that “determining whether a plaintiff has alleged a domestic in- jury [for purposes of RICO] is a context-specifc inquiry that turns largely on the particular facts alleged in a complaint.” F. th, at . Specifcally, courts should look to the cir- cumstances surrounding the alleged injury to assess whether Page Proof Pending Publication YEGIAZARYAN v. SMAGIN Opinion of the Court it arose in the United States. In this suit, that means look- ing to the nature of the alleged injury, the racketeering ac- tivity that directly caused it, and the injurious aims and effects of that activity. This approach to the domestic-injury requirement is most consistent with RJR Nabisco. There, the Court clarifed that its domestic-injury requirement “does not mean that foreign plaintiffs may not sue under RICO.” U. S., at , n. . Similarly, the Court explained that “application of [the domestic-injury] rule in any given case will not always be self-evident, as disputes may arise as to whether a partic- ular alleged injury is `foreign' or `domestic.' ” Id., at . These remarks point toward a case-specifc inquiry that con- siders the particular facts surrounding the alleged injury. Petitioners' bright-line rule, in contrast, dispenses with any such subtlety. It makes the location of the plaintiff's resi- dence determinative, thus barring all foreign plaintiffs, ex- actly as RJR Nabisco said it was not doing. A contextual approach to the domestic-injury requirement also better refects the requirement's origin in step two of the extraterritoriality framework, which assesses whether there is a domestic application of a statute by looking to the statute's focus. RJR Nabisco implied that the focus of § (c) is injuries in “business or property by reason of a violation of [RICO's substantive provisions].” § (c). This focus makes sense because, in the context of RICO, “the compensable injury necessarily is the harm caused by predi- cate acts suffciently related to constitute a pattern, for the essence of the violation is the commission of those acts in connection with the conduct of an enterprise.” Sedima, S. The alleged RICO violation must have proximately caused the injury in order for the plaintiff to be able to sue under § (c). See Holmes v. Securities Investor Protection Corporation, U. S. , (); Anza v. Ideal Steel Supply Corp., U. S. , – () (des- cribing the proximate causation requirement as a “directness requiremen[t]”). Page Proof Pending Publication Cite as: U. S. () Opinion of the Court P. R. L. v. Imrex Co., U. S. , (). So under- stood, § (c)'s focus is on the injury, not in isolation, but as the product of racketeering activity. Thus, in assessing whether there is a domestic injury, courts should engage in a case-specifc analysis that looks to the circumstances sur- rounding the injury. If those circumstances suffciently ground the injury in the United States, such that it is clear the injury arose domestically, then the plaintiff has alleged a domestic injury. Because of the contextual nature of the inquiry, no set of factors can capture the relevant considerations for all cases. RICO covers a wide range of predicate acts and is notori- ously “expansive” in scope. Id., at –. Thus, depend- ing on the allegations, what is relevant in one case to assess- ing where the injury arose may not be pertinent in another. While a bright-line rule would no doubt be easier to apply, fealty to the statute's focus requires a more nuanced approach. D This suit illustrates well why the domestic-injury inquiry must account for the facts of the case, rather than rely on a residency-based rule. While it may be true, in some sense, that Smagin has felt his economic injury in Russia, focusing solely on that fact would miss central features of the alleged injury. Zooming out, the circumstances surrounding Sma- gin's injury make clear it arose in the United States. Smagin alleges that he “has been injured in his inability to collect [his] massive judgment.” App. a. Much of the alleged racketeering activity that caused the injury occurred in the United States. Yegiazaryan took domestic actions to avoid collection, including allegedly creating U. S. shell com- panies to hide his U. S. assets, submitting a forged doctor's note to a California District Court, and intimidating a U. S.- based witness. It is true that other components of the scheme occurred abroad. As Smagin alleges, however, even those “wrongful acts and plans were devised, initiated, and Page Proof Pending Publication YEGIAZARYAN v. SMAGIN Opinion of the Court carried out . . . through acts and communications initiated in and directed towards Los Angeles County, California,” with the “central purpose of frustrating enforcement of [the] Cali- fornia judgment.” Id., at a–a. Further, the injurious effects of the racketeering activity largely manifested in California. Smagin obtained a judg- ment in California because that is where Yegiazaryan lives, and where Smagin had thus hoped to collect. The rights that the California judgment provides to Smagin exist only in California, including the right to obtain postjudgment dis- covery, the right to seize assets in California, and the right to seek other appropriate relief from the California District Court. The alleged RICO scheme thwarted those rights, thereby undercutting the orders of the California District Court and Smagin's efforts to collect on Yegiazaryan's assets in California. In sum, Smagin's interests in his California judgment against Yegiazaryan, a California resident, were directly in- jured by racketeering activity either taken in California or directed from California, with the aim and effect of subvert- ing Smagin's rights to execute on that judgment in Califor- nia. On the Court's contextual approach, those allegations suffce to state a domestic injury in this suit. III Petitioners argue that a contextual approach is inconsist- ent with certain common-law principles, which instead favor their bright-line rule. According to petitioners, because Smagin has alleged an “economic injury” or an “injury in intangible property,” Brief in Opposition –, courts should look to common-law principles governing “the situs” of such injuries, when determining whether those injuries are foreign or domestic. Specifcally, as to economic inju- ries, petitioners point to the Restatement (First) of Confict of Laws § (), from which they discern the principle that “a fraud plaintiff suffer[s] an economic loss at the plain- Page Proof Pending Publication Cite as: U. S. () Opinion of the Court tiff's domicile.” Brief for Petitioners ; see also Sack v. Low, F. d , (CA ) (Under the First Restate- ment, “loss from fraud is deemed to be suffered where its economic impact is felt, normally the plaintiff's residence”). As to intangible injuries, petitioners further rely on the prin- ciple of mobilia sequuntur personam, which they claim “generally locat[es] intangible property at the domicile of its owner.” Brief for Petitioners . Both principles, they argue, locate Smagin's alleged injury at his residence. Petitioners fall short, however, when explaining the rele- vance of these principles. They do not clearly explain why choice-of-law principles are germane here, let alone why the First Restatement dictates those principles. Meanwhile, it is far from clear that petitioners' gloss on the principle of mobilia sequuntur personam was as well established or as wide sweeping as petitioners take it to be, in light of the many twists and turns in the doctrine across a range of con- texts. See A. Simowitz, Siting Intangibles, N. Y. U. J. Int'l L. & Pol. , – (). In short, at the time of RICO's enactment, both principles were hardly “settled . . . at common law.” Beck v. Prupis, U. S. , (). The core problem with petitioners' approach is that it is unmoored from the presumption against extraterritoriality. While legal fctions regarding the situs of economic injuries and intangible property have their justifcations in other areas of law, those justifcations do not necessarily translate to the presumption against extraterritoriality, with its dis- Although the First Restatement was in effect in , when RICO was enacted, numerous jurisdictions had by then moved away from the First Restatement's methodology and toward a “ `most signifcant relationship' ” test, which resembles “the kind of `multi-factor' analysis the Court of Ap- peals conducted here.” Brief for George A. Bermann as Amicus Curiae . This shift was refected in § of the Restatement (Second) of Con- fict of Laws, which superseded the First Restatement the following year in . Thus, even assuming choice-of-law principles are relevant, peti- tioners' identifcation and application of those principles is questionable. Page Proof Pending Publication YEGIAZARYAN v. SMAGIN Opinion of the Court tinctive concerns for comity and discerning congressional meaning. Indeed, it is because petitioners' view invokes these fc- tions that it generates results so counter to comity and so far afeld from any reasonable interpretation of what qualifes as a domestic application of § (c). On petitioners' primary view, a business owner who resides abroad but owns a brick- and-mortar business in the United States cannot bring a § (c) suit even if an American RICO organization burns down her storefront. Perhaps aware of how odd this seems, petitioners offer a fallback rule for intangible property. That rule fares no better. It provides that if racketeering activity targets the intangible business interests of two U. S. businesses, one owned by a U. S. resident and one owned by someone living abroad, only the former business owner can bring a § (c) suit. There is no evidence Congress in- tended to impose such a double standard, especially because doing so runs its own risks of generating international dis- cord. These implausible consequences are strong evidence that petitioners have gone astray in assessing the focus of § (c) and, thus, the meaning of “domestic injury” as con- templated by RJR Nabisco. Finally, petitioners, as well as the dissent, post, at (opinion of Alito, J.), argue that a contextual approach is unworkable because it does not provide a bright-line rule. Reply Brief –. An approach is not unworkable, how- ever, merely because it directs courts to consider the case- specifc circumstances surrounding an injury when assessing where it arises. While “the ease with which [petitioners'] bright-line rule can be applied gives it some surface appeal,” Humphrey, F. d, at , a look beneath the surface quickly reveals that the test is inconsistent with RJR Nabi- sco, the presumption against extraterritoriality, and the thrust of § (c) itself. Concerns about a fact-intensive test cannot displace congressional policy choices, where a more nuanced test is true to the statute's meaning. Page Proof Pending Publication Cite as: U. S. ()
