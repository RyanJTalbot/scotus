"REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF: NEAL K. KATYAL, ESQ."," MR. KATYAL:  Thank you, Mr. Chief "
"REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF: NEAL K. KATYAL, ESQ.","Justice, and may it please the Court: "
"REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF: NEAL K. KATYAL, ESQ.",This case concerns a piece of 
"REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF: NEAL K. KATYAL, ESQ.","statutory text from 1974 in Section 2503, which is found in the blue brief appendix at page 2a. That provision exempts from the common law a narrow set of instruments:  a money order, traveler's check, or other similar written instrument other than a third- party bank check. "
"REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF: NEAL K. KATYAL, ESQ.",The question today is whether two 
"REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF: NEAL K. KATYAL, ESQ.","products, MoneyGram agent checks and MoneyGram teller's checks, fall within that exemption. For many years, the defendant states answered that question ""no.""  However, after engaging some creative consultants, they changed their mind. "

"REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF: NEAL K. KATYAL, ESQ.","four separate reasons.  First, when Congress adopted that language in 1974, the term ""money"
"REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF: NEAL K. KATYAL, ESQ."," order"" referred to specific commercial products labeled ""money order"" and typically sold to unbanked consumers to pay small debts.  Neither "
"REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF: NEAL K. KATYAL, ESQ.","of those apply to the two disputed instruments here. They're not labeled ""money order,"" and they are sold to consumers with bank accounts who are transferring larger sums of money. "
"REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF: NEAL K. KATYAL, ESQ.","Second, the FDA was a surgical fix to "
"REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF: NEAL K. KATYAL, ESQ.","this Court's 1972 decision with a key purpose behind it, to prevent the price of small- dollar "
"REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF: NEAL K. KATYAL, ESQ.",instruments from increasing drew to --due to 
"REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF: NEAL K. KATYAL, ESQ.","address collection requirements that states might adopt in reaction to this Court's 1972 decision.  That rationale does not apply here, and the two instruments are outside of the FDA altogether. "
"REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF: NEAL K. KATYAL, ESQ.","Third, even if you thought these "
"REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF: NEAL K. KATYAL, ESQ.","products were within the FDA, the two instruments here fall within the third- party "
"REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF: NEAL K. KATYAL, ESQ.","bank check exception.  Like all bank checks, they are signed by bank employees, not purchasers. "

"REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF: NEAL K. KATYAL, ESQ.", would independently break any tie for us.
"REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF: NEAL K. KATYAL, ESQ.", One is the doctrine of reading 
"REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF: NEAL K. KATYAL, ESQ.","statutes to avoid derogation of the common law,"
"REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF: NEAL K. KATYAL, ESQ.", and the other is this Court's repeated emphasis on the need for bright -line rules and

"REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF: NEAL K. KATYAL, ESQ.",The defendants' interpretation would

"REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF: NEAL K. KATYAL, ESQ.", for this information?  Would that cost a lot of money?
"REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF: NEAL K. KATYAL, ESQ.", MR. KATYAL: Right.  The -- the -- the
"REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF: NEAL K. KATYAL, ESQ.", record doesn't say.  I suppose it probably does cost a little bit of money.  And MoneyGram's

"REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF: NEAL K. KATYAL, ESQ.",So it's a very easy statutory fix 
"REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF: NEAL K. KATYAL, ESQ.","because states will get money that they otherwise wouldn't get.  And that wasn't available in 1974.  That's what makes this case so different from the 1974 FDA, because there, and Congress specifically, as I was saying to Justice Jackson, in 2501 made a specific finding, address information is not being collected for traveler's checks, not being collected for money orders, and if you impose that requirement on those small- dollar "

"REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF: NEAL K. KATYAL, ESQ.","These are, of course, large- dollar "

"REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF: NEAL K. KATYAL, ESQ.",But isn't it the bank's liability and not the signature that makes an instrument a bank check? The signature merely indicates that the bank is

"REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF: NEAL K. KATYAL, ESQ."," MR. KATYAL: No, Your Honor, I think"
"REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF: NEAL K. KATYAL, ESQ.", the signat ure is the thing that does make the

"REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF: NEAL K. KATYAL, ESQ.","to Munn's, which we cite to in our brief, for exactly that. And I think your question's really important because Judge Leval said, well, I'm going to look to the Hunt Commission to determine what a third -party bank check is, and "

"REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF: NEAL K. KATYAL, ESQ."," ON BEHALF OF ARKANSAS, ET AL. "
"REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF: NEAL K. KATYAL, ESQ.","MR. BRONNI: Mr. Chief Justice, and"
"REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF: NEAL K. KATYAL, ESQ.", may it please the Court:
"REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF: NEAL K. KATYAL, ESQ.", This case presents the problem the FDA
"REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF: NEAL K. KATYAL, ESQ."," was enacted to solve.  In Pennsylvania versus New York, this Court c oncluded that unclaimed"
"REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF: NEAL K. KATYAL, ESQ."," financial instruments escheat to a purchaser's state of residence or, if that's unknown, to an "
"REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF: NEAL K. KATYAL, ESQ.",issuer's state of incorporation. 
"REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF: NEAL K. KATYAL, ESQ.",Because issuers of certain financial 
"REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF: NEAL K. KATYAL, ESQ.","instruments rarely kept purchaser addresses, that meant a windfall for an issuer's state of incorporation at the expense of its fellow states. "
"REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF: NEAL K. KATYAL, ESQ.","Just two years later, Congress "
"REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF: NEAL K. KATYAL, ESQ.","responded to that inequity by enacting the FDA. That statute says that where addresses aren't typically kept for a class of instruments, those instruments escheat to the state of purchase. "
"REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF: NEAL K. KATYAL, ESQ.","Now, 50 years later, Delaware claims "

"REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF: NEAL K. KATYAL, ESQ.",precisely like other money orders but are
"REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF: NEAL K. KATYAL, ESQ.", marketed differently.  But marketing strategies 
"REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF: NEAL K. KATYAL, ESQ.",do not define commercial instruments and they
"REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF: NEAL K. KATYAL, ESQ."," don't justify $250 million windfalls.           Recognizing the weakness of that argument, Delaware alternatively claims that MoneyGram official checks are excluded from the FDA as third- party bank checks. That argument"
"REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF: NEAL K. KATYAL, ESQ.", fares no better because MoneyGram is not a third 
"REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF: NEAL K. KATYAL, ESQ.","party as that term was used in 1974, and MoneyGram's official checks are absolutely not bank checks. "
"REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF: NEAL K. KATYAL, ESQ.","Nor, for that matter, does Delaware "
"REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF: NEAL K. KATYAL, ESQ.",explain why Congress would have chosen to exclude instruments that present precisely the windfall problem that the FDA targeted. 
"REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF: NEAL K. KATYAL, ESQ.",So it's hardly surprising that all 
"REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF: NEAL K. KATYAL, ESQ.","three payment systems experts in this case, including Delaware's own expert, agreed that under any ordinary understanding of the phrase ""third-party bank check,"" MoneyGram official "
"REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF: NEAL K. KATYAL, ESQ.",checks are not third- party bank checks. 
"REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF: NEAL K. KATYAL, ESQ.",So we would ask this Court to overrule 
"REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF: NEAL K. KATYAL, ESQ.",the exceptions and adopt the Special Master's recommendation.

"REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF: NEAL K. KATYAL, ESQ."," MR. BRONNI: Sure, Your Honor.  I "
"REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF: NEAL K. KATYAL, ESQ.",think it's probably easiest to begin with --with the example of cashier's checks because there's been a lot of ink spilled on the

"REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF: NEAL K. KATYAL, ESQ.","and, for that one, we don't believe that cashier's checks are necessarily covered by our definition. "
"REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF: NEAL K. KATYAL, ESQ.","So, to -- to begin with, our "
"REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF: NEAL K. KATYAL, ESQ.","definition requires that an instrument be prepaid.  A cashier's check as a class of instrument is not necessarily a prepaid instrument.  Instead, as the ABA's amicus brief argues at length, there are many frequent, common, ordinary, everyday situations where cashier's checks are not prepaid. "
"REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF: NEAL K. KATYAL, ESQ.","So, for instance, if a bank needs to "
"REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF: NEAL K. KATYAL, ESQ.","pay its own obligations, say it needs to pay an electrician or meet a tax bill, it will issue a check drawn on its own accounts. That's a cashier's check.  That is not a prepaid instrument. "

"REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF: NEAL K. KATYAL, ESQ."," If you -- their argument is essentially, if you "

"REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF: NEAL K. KATYAL, ESQ.", would be the Western Union example.  If Western Union tomorrow made a decision that it was going

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I --I --I,"You know, Delaware's definition of a "

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I --I --I,"issuer or processor could be a third party in 1974, and it can't for the reasons the experts explain, but these instruments don't even meet Delaware's own definition of a bank check.  So Delaware says that in order to be a third- party "
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I --I --I,"bank check, something must first be a bank check. "
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I --I --I,As I mentioned earlier when we were

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I --I --I, where they say that a -- a bank check is an

That's a classic or traditional teller's check. "
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I --I --I,"Again, that does not describe these "
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I --I --I,"instruments here.  When the bank officer signs, one, he's signing as an agent of MoneyGram.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I --I --I, it --they've agreed that it has to at least be

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I --I --I," Instead, when -- when somebody"
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I --I --I," referred to the third party on a check or third party in a financial instrument, that third-party reference was always a reference to "
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I --I --I,a payee or the party that ultimately got paid on
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I --I --I, an instrument.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I --I --I," So sometimes, for instance, it was "
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I --I --I,"used like in the twice endorsed check definition, where a third- party check is a "
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I --I --I,"common enough phrase then and today that it's actually defined in Black's Law Dictionary as a twice endorsed check.  So the third party on that instrument is the endorsee, the third party to the original transaction who is the -- the "
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I --I --I,payee on that instrument. 
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I --I --I,The other way the phrase third party 
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I --I --I,and check got used in the 1970s was in the context of third -party payment services or 
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I --I --I,"third-party services, and there again, the "

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I --I --I,"outside of the context of this case, I'm not aware of a situation where anybody -- they"
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I --I --I," allude, for instance, to private realtors, not "
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I --I --I,"to states having brought suits over cashier's checks, and even in those cases, nobody that I'm aware of is arguing that a cashier's check is a money order.  Instead, those cases are all about the ""similar written instruments"" clause. "
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I --I --I,"But either way, I don't think that our "
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I --I --I,"definition, as I started by saying, necessarily requires treating them that way. I think they're well- known instruments.  And if -- if "
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I --I --I,"Congress had intended to include them, it probably would have used that language because they were well -known instruments at the time and "
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I --I --I,they just don't fit what Congress describes in 2501 as --as a money order because they're not

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I --I --I, seems as though your friend says that really 
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I --I --I,"Congress was worried about no addresses, and, as a result, large- money instruments wouldn't fit "
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I --I --I,in the statute because there was an incentive to have addresses. 
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I --I --I,And I understood you to be focusing on 
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I --I --I,"Congress's be -- concern about inequitable escheatment, in which case these instruments would be covered.  So can you just, as a final word here, talk about what the purpose of this statute is? "
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I --I --I,"MR. BRONNI: I -- I -- I -- well, I'll "
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I --I --I,start with the purpose of the statute is to address those instruments that presented the windfall inequity problem associated with the Court's common law rule.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I --I --I, MoneyGram does not keep addresses.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I --I --I, And it's the -- the -- the point here

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I --I --I, His answer to that was -- to say to
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I --I --I," the Chief Justice, was, well, Congress put its thumb on the scale.  They did with respect to "
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I --I --I,"those two instruments.  The question in this case is, did they do so for anything more than that? And the reasons why Congress isolated"
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I --I --I, those two instruments don't apply here. 
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I --I --I,The other point is Congress is the 
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I --I --I,"solution to this.  Even if you don't think states will have this easy fix, which I can't understand to this day why they haven't done it, but Congress can, of course, do that.  That's what you said in the Delaware case in 1993.  If you're worried about equity concerns, Congress should fix it. And what did you point to in that --in that decision?  You literally pointed "
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I --I --I,to 2503 and said that's the solution if you're worried about equity concerns.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I --I --I," But, with the definition of"
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I --I --I," ""third-party bank check,"" I think, Mr. Chief "
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I --I --I,"Justice, you said, well, nobody really knows what it means. We actually think the Hunt Commission does know what it means, and they"
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I --I --I," told you what it means in that report, and that says teller's checks are included. "
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I --I --I,Now my friend says --this is our 
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I --I --I,third point -- that cashier's and certified 
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I --I --I,"checks are different.  Well, first of all, note that he doesn't necessarily -- he doesn't "
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I --I --I,"disclaim them.  He says, well, we're not necessarily saying it. "
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I --I --I,There's already litigation about 
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I --I --I,"cashier's checks and certified checks, as the ABA brief points out. There have been qui tam lawsuits that have been filed. He says, well, cashier's checks aren't prepaid. Most cashier's and certified checks are prepaid.  The only ones that aren't prepaid are the ones in which banks are paying their own expenses, and our brief explains why we think those types of checks are covered under the statute. "

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I --I --I,"-- you had said -- or, excuse me, Justice --Justice Jackson, you had said the question in"
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I --I --I," this case is, what is the field that Congress occupied?  Congress knew exactly how to write the statute they want. They had the 1966 example.  They didn't do that here.  They wrote "
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I --I --I,a much more narrow statute. 
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I --I --I,"And if you define, Justice Jackson, a "
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I --I --I,"money order as anything that transmits money that is prepaid, you blow up the statute.  It means you can't explain what ""traveler's checks"" means. You can't explain what is left for ""other similar written instruments.""  Everything would be a money order.  Nothing would be similar to a --nothing would be similar to it. "
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I --I --I,And that's why Congress -- we think 
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I --I --I,"you should look to the rationales behind what Congress did.  You pointed to the legislative history and the Treasury Department, but th e "
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I --I --I,Treasury Department just says essentially that this is a belt -and-suspenders fix.  It doesn't 
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I --I --I,say that --it doesn't say that -- that -- that

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I --I --I," And, finally and last, if you adopt"
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I --I --I," our solution, the common law, it incentivizes "
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I --I --I,exactly the kind of concerns that Justice Alito was worried about in Yee. It avoids any
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I --I --I," questions about these other instruments, from "
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I --I --I,"gift cards to cashier's checks to bearer's bonds and the like, and it avoids threatening the common law primary rule because a primary rule is creditor addresses.  And, Justice Thomas, your opinion in Delaware said that has venerable, old roots going all the way back to Old England. "
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I --I --I,"If they win, forget about place of "
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I --I --I,"incorporation.  If they win, the primary rule of the FDA will control, which is to move away from last creditors' addresses.
