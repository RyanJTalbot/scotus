Page Proof Pending Publication OCTOBER TERM, Syllabus GONZALEZ v. GOOGLE LLC certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit No. –. Argued February , —Decided May , In , Nohemi Gonzalez, a U. S. citizen, was killed in a set of coordinated terrorist attacks carried out across Paris, France, under the direction of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). Gonzalez's parents and brothers sued Google LLC under U. S. C. § (a) and (d)(), alleging that Google was both directly and secondarily liable for the terrorist attack that killed Gonzalez. With regard to their secondary-liability claims under § (d)(), plaintiffs alleged that Google aided and abet- ted and conspired with ISIS through ISIS' use of YouTube, which Google owns and operates. The District Court dismissed plaintiffs' complaint for failure to state a claim, though it offered plaintiffs leave to amend their complaint. Plaintiffs opted to appeal, and the Ninth Circuit affrmed in a consolidated opinion that the Court also addressed in Twitter, Inc. v. Taamneh, U. S. . With regard to this case, the Ninth Circuit held that most of plaintiffs' claims were barred by § of the Communications Decency Act of . The sole exceptions were claims based on allegations that YouTube maintained a revenue- sharing system through which Google approved ISIS videos and shared revenue with ISIS; however, the court held that those allegations failed to state a viable claim in any event. Plaintiffs sought review in this Court of the Ninth Circuit's application of § but not of that court's holdings regarding the revenue-sharing claims. Held: The Court declines to address the application of § to a complaint that appears to state little, if any, plausible claim for relief. The secondary-liability claims here are materially identical to those in the Twitter plaintiffs' complaint, and thus it appears to follow from the hold- ing of that case that the complaint here fails to state a claim for aiding and abetting under § (d)(). The remainder of plaintiffs' claims here may be barred by the Ninth Circuit's unchallenged holdings below. Accordingly, the Court remands the case for the Ninth Circuit to con- sider plaintiffs' complaint in light of this Court's decision in Twitter. Pp. –. F. th , vacated and remanded.

In some form or another, it has been designated a Foreign Terrorist Organization since ; ISIS has also been known as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, al Qaeda in Iraq, and the al-Zarqawi Network. Page Proof Pending Publication Cite as: U. S. () Per Curiam U. S. C. §§ (a) and (d)(), alleging that Google was both directly and secondarily liable for the terrorist attack that killed Gonzalez. For their secondary-liability claims, plain- tiffs alleged that Google aided and abetted and conspired with ISIS. All of their claims broadly center on the use of YouTube, which Google owns and operates, by ISIS and ISIS supporters. The District Court dismissed plaintiffs' complaint for fail- ure to state a claim, though it offered plaintiffs leave to amend their complaint. Instead, plaintiffs stood on their complaint and appealed, and the Ninth Circuit affrmed in a consolidated opinion that we also addressed in Twitter, Inc. v. Taamneh, U. S. (). F. th (). With respect to this case, the Ninth Circuit held that most of the plaintiffs' claims were barred by § of the Communications Decency Act of , Stat. , U. S. C. § (c)(). The sole exceptions were plaintiffs' direct- and secondary- liability claims based on allegations that Google approved ISIS videos for advertisements and then shared proceeds with ISIS through YouTube's revenue-sharing system. The Ninth Circuit held that these potential claims were not barred by § , but that plaintiffs' allegations failed to state a viable claim in any event. Title U. S. C. § (a) provides: “Any national of the United States injured in his or her person, property, or business by reason of an act of international terrorism, or his or her estate, survivors, or heirs, may sue therefor in any appropriate district court of the United States and shall recover threefold the damages he or she sustains and the cost of the suit, including attorney's fees.” Section (d)() provides: “In an action under subsection (a) for an injury arising from an act of international ter- rorism committed, planned, or authorized by an organization that had been designated as a foreign terrorist organization under section of the Immigration and Nationality Act ( U. S. C. ), as of the date on which such act of international terrorism was committed, planned, or authorized, liability may be asserted as to any person who aids and abets, by know- ingly providing substantial assistance, or who conspires with the person who committed such an act of international terrorism.” Page Proof Pending Publication GONZALEZ v. GOOGLE LLC Per Curiam We granted certiorari to review the Ninth Circuit's appli- cation of § . See U. S. ––– (). Plaintiffs did not seek review of the Ninth Circuit's holdings regarding their revenue-sharing claims. In light of those unchallenged hold- ings and our disposition of Twitter, on which we also granted certiorari and in which we today reverse the Ninth Circuit's judgment, it has become clear that plaintiffs' complaint— independent of § —states little if any claim for relief. As plaintiffs concede, the allegations underlying their secondary-liability claims are materially identical to those at issue in Twitter. See Tr. of Oral Arg. . Since we hold that the complaint in that case fails to state a claim for aiding and abetting under § (d)(), it appears to follow that the complaint here likewise fails to state such a claim. And, in discussing plaintiffs' revenue-sharing claims, the Ninth Cir- cuit held that plaintiffs plausibly alleged neither that “Google reached an agreement with ISIS,” as required for conspiracy liability, nor that Google's acts were “intended to intimidate or coerce a civilian population, or to infuence or affect a government,” as required for a direct-liability claim under § (a). F. th, at , . Perhaps for that reason, at oral argument, plaintiffs only suggested that they should receive leave to amend their complaint if we were to reverse and remand in Twitter. Tr. of Oral Arg. , . We need not resolve either the viability of plaintiffs' claims as a whole or whether plaintiffs should receive further leave to amend. Rather, we think it suffcient to acknowledge that much (if not all) of plaintiffs' complaint seems to fail under either our decision in Twitter or the Ninth Circuit's unchallenged holdings below. We therefore decline to ad- dress the application of § to a complaint that appears to state little, if any, plausible claim for relief. Instead, we va- cate the judgment below and remand the case for the Ninth Circuit to consider plaintiffs' complaint in light of our deci- sion in Twitter. It is so ordered.
