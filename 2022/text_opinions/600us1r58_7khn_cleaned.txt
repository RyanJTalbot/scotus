OCTOBER TERM, Syllabus CREATIVE LLC et al. v. ELENIS et al. certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the tenth circuit No. –. Argued December , —Decided June , Lorie Smith wants to expand her graphic design business, Creative LLC, to include services for couples seeking wedding websites. But Ms. Smith worries that Colorado will use the Colorado Anti-Discrimination Act to compel her—in violation of the First Amendment—to create web- sites celebrating marriages she does not endorse. To clarify her rights, Ms. Smith fled a lawsuit seeking an injunction to prevent the State from forcing her to create websites celebrating marriages that defy her belief that marriage should be reserved to unions between one man and one woman. CADA prohibits all “public accommodations” from denying “the full and equal enjoyment” of its goods and services to any customer based on his race, creed, disability, sexual orientation, or other statutorily enu- merated trait. Colo. Rev. Stat. §––()(a). The law defnes “public accommodation” broadly to include almost every public-facing business in the State. § ––(). Either state offcials or private citizens may bring actions to enforce the law. §§ ––, –– (). And a variety of penalties can follow any violation. Before the district court, Ms. Smith and the State stipulated to a number of facts: Ms. Smith is “willing to work with all people regardless of classifcations such as race, creed, sexual orientation, and gender” and “will gladly create custom graphics and websites” for clients of any sex- ual orientation; she will not produce content that “contradicts biblical truth” regardless of who orders it; Ms. Smith's belief that marriage is a union between one man and one woman is a sincerely held conviction; Ms. Smith provides design services that are “expressive” and her “origi- nal, customized” creations “contribut[e] to the overall message” her business conveys “through the websites” it creates; the wedding web- sites she plans to create “will be expressive in nature,” will be “custo- mized and tailored” through close collaboration with individual couples, and will “express Ms. Smith's and Creative's message celebrating and promoting” her view of marriage; viewers of Ms. Smith's websites “will know that the websites are her original artwork;” and “[t]here are numerous companies in the State of Colorado and across the nation that offer custom website design services.” Page Proof Pending Publication Page Proof Pending Publication Cite as: U. S. () Syllabus Ultimately, the district court held that Ms. Smith was not entitled to the injunction she sought, and the Tenth Circuit affrmed. Held: The First Amendment prohibits Colorado from forcing a website designer to create expressive designs speaking messages with which the designer disagrees. Pp. –. (a) The framers designed the Free Speech Clause of the First Amend- ment to protect the “freedom to think as you will and to speak as you think.” Boy Scouts of America v. Dale, U. S. , – (inter- nal quotation marks omitted). The freedom to speak is among our in- alienable rights. The freedom of thought and speech is “indispensable to the discovery and spread of political truth.” Whitney v. California, U. S. , (Brandeis, J., concurring). For these reasons, “[i]f there is any fxed star in our constitutional constellation,” West Virginia Bd. of Ed. v. Barnette, U. S. , , it is the principle that the government may not interfere with “an uninhibited marketplace of ideas,” McCullen v. Coakley, U. S. , (internal quotation marks omitted). This Court has previously faced cases where governments have sought to test these foundational principles. In Barnette, the Court held that the State of West Virginia's efforts to compel schoolchildren to salute the Nation's fag and recite the Pledge of Allegiance “invad[ed] the sphere of intellect and spirit which it is the purpose of the First Amendment . . . to reserve from all offcial control.” U. S., at . State authorities had “transcend[ed] constitutional limitations on their powers.” Ibid. In Hurley v. Irish-American Gay, Lesbian and Bisex- ual Group of Boston, Inc., U. S. , the Court held that Massachu- setts's public accommodations statute could not be used to force veter- ans organizing a parade in Boston to include a group of gay, lesbian, and bisexual individuals because the parade was protected speech, and requiring the veterans to include voices they wished to exclude would impermissibly require them to “alter the expressive content of their parade.” Id., at –. And in Boy Scouts of America v. Dale, when the Boy Scouts sought to exclude assistant scoutmaster James Dale from membership after learning he was gay, the Court held the Boy Scouts to be “an expressive association” entitled to First Amend- ment protection. U. S., at . The Court found that forcing the Scouts to include Mr. Dale would undoubtedly “interfere with [its] choice not to propound a point of view contrary to its beliefs.” Id., at . These cases illustrate that the First Amendment protects an individu- al's right to speak his mind regardless of whether the government con- CREATIVE LLC v. ELENIS Syllabus siders his speech sensible and well intentioned or deeply “misguided,” Hurley, U. S., at , and likely to cause “anguish” or “incalculable grief,” Snyder v. Phelps, U. S. , . Generally, too, the govern- ment may not compel a person to speak its own preferred messages. See Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School Dist., U. S. , . Pp. –. (b) Applying these principles to the parties' stipulated facts, the Court agrees with the Tenth Circuit that the wedding websites Ms. Smith seeks to create qualify as pure speech protected by the First Amendment under this Court's precedents. Ms. Smith's websites will express and communicate ideas—namely, those that “celebrate and pro- mote the couple's wedding and unique love story” and those that “cele- brat[e] and promot[e]” what Ms. Smith understands to be a marriage. Speech conveyed over the internet, like all other manner of speech, qual- ifes for the First Amendment's protections. And the Court agrees with the Tenth Circuit that the wedding websites Ms. Smith seeks to create involve her speech, a conclusion supported by the parties' stipula- tions, including that Ms. Smith intends to produce a fnal story for each couple using her own words and original artwork. While Ms. Smith's speech may combine with the couple's in a fnal product, an individual “does not forfeit constitutional protection simply by combining multifar- ious voices” in a single communication. Hurley, U. S., at . Ms. Smith seeks to engage in protected First Amendment speech; Colorado seeks to compel speech she does not wish to provide. As the Tenth Circuit observed, if Ms. Smith offers wedding websites celebrat- ing marriages she endorses, the State intends to compel her to create custom websites celebrating other marriages she does not. F. th , . Colorado seeks to compel this speech in order to “excis[e] certain ideas or viewpoints from the public dialogue.” Turner Broad- casting System, Inc. v. FCC, U. S. , . Indeed, the Tenth Cir- cuit recognized that the coercive “[e]liminati[on]” of dissenting ideas about marriage constitutes Colorado's “very purpose” in seeking to apply its law to Ms. Smith. F. th, at . But while the Tenth Circuit thought that Colorado could compel speech from Ms. Smith con- sistent with the Constitution, this Court's First Amendment precedents teach otherwise. In Hurley, Dale, and Barnette, the Court found that governments impermissibly compelled speech in violation of the First Amendment when they tried to force speakers to accept a message with which they disagreed. Here, Colorado seeks to put Ms. Smith to a simi- lar choice. If she wishes to speak, she must either speak as the State demands or face sanctions for expressing her own beliefs, sanctions that may include compulsory participation in “remedial . . . training,” fling periodic compliance reports, and paying monetary fnes. That is an im- Page Proof Pending Publication Page Proof Pending Publication Cite as: U. S. () Syllabus permissible abridgment of the First Amendment's right to speak freely. Hurley, U. S., at . Under Colorado's logic, the government may compel anyone who speaks for pay on a given topic to accept all commissions on that same topic—no matter the message—if the topic somehow implicates a cus- tomer's statutorily protected trait. F. th, at (Tymkovich, C. J., dissenting). Taken seriously, that principle would allow the govern- ment to force all manner of artists, speechwriters, and others whose services involve speech to speak what they do not believe on pain of penalty. The Court's precedents recognize the First Amendment toler- ates none of that. To be sure, public accommodations laws play a vital role in realizing the civil rights of all Americans, and governments in this country have a “compelling interest” in eliminating discrimination in places of public accommodation. Roberts v. United States Jaycees, U. S. , . This Court has recognized that public accommoda- tions laws “vindicate the deprivation of personal dignity that surely ac- companies denials of equal access to public establishments.” Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v. United States, U. S. , (internal quota- tion marks omitted). Over time, governments in this country have ex- panded public accommodations laws in notable ways. Statutes like Col- orado's grow from nondiscrimination rules the common law sometimes imposed on common carriers and places of traditional public accommoda- tion like hotels and restaurants. Dale, U. S., at –. Often, these enterprises exercised something like monopoly power or hosted or transported others or their belongings. See, e. g., Liverpool & Great Western Steam Co. v. Phenix Ins. Co., U. S. , . Importantly, States have also expanded their laws to prohibit more forms of discrimi- nation. Today, for example, approximately half the States have laws like Colorado's that expressly prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. The Court has recognized this is “unexceptional.” Masterpiece Cakeshop, Ltd. v. Colorado Civil Rights Comm'n, U. S. –––, –––. States may “protect gay persons, just as [they] can protect other classes of individuals, in acquiring whatever products and services they choose on the same terms and conditions as are offered to other members of the public. And there are no doubt innumerable goods and services that no one could argue implicate the First Amendment.” Ibid. At the same time, this Court has also long recognized that no public accommodations law is immune from the demands of the Constitu- tion. In particular, this Court has held, public accommodations statutes can sweep too broadly when deployed to compel speech. See, e. g., Hur- ley, U. S., at , ; Dale, U. S., at . As in those cases, when Colorado's public accommodations law and the Constitution collide, there can be no question which must prevail. U. S. Const. Art. VI, § . Page Proof Pending Publication CREATIVE LLC v. ELENIS Syllabus As the Tenth Circuit saw it, Colorado has a compelling interest in ensuring “equal access to publicly available goods and services,” and no option short of coercing speech from Ms. Smith can satisfy that interest because she plans to offer “unique services” that are, “by defnition, unavailable elsewhere.” F. th, at – (internal quotation marks omitted). In some sense, of course, her voice is unique; so is everyone's. But that hardly means a State may coopt an individual's voice for its own purposes. The speaker in Hurley had an “enviable” outlet for speech, and the Boy Scouts in Dale offered an arguably unique experience, but in both cases this Court held that the State could not use its public accommodations statute to deny a speaker the right “to choose the content of his own message.” Hurley, U. S., at ; see Dale, U. S., at –. A rule otherwise would conscript any unique voice to disseminate the government's preferred messages in vio- lation of the First Amendment. Pp. –. (c) Colorado now seems to acknowledge that the First Amendment does prohibit it from coercing Ms. Smith to create websites expressing any message with which she disagrees. Alternatively, Colorado con- tends, Ms. Smith must simply provide the same commercial product to all, which she can do by repurposing websites celebrating marriages she does endorse for marriages she does not. Colorado's theory rests on a belief that this case does not implicate pure speech, but rather the sale of an ordinary commercial product, and that any burden on Ms. Smith's speech is purely “incidental.” On the State's telling, then, speech more or less vanishes from the picture—and, with it, any need for First Amendment scrutiny. Colorado's alternative theory, however, does not sit easily with its stipulation that Ms. Smith does not seek to sell an ordinary commercial good but intends to create “customized and tai- lored” expressive speech for each couple “to celebrate and promote the couple's wedding and unique love story.” Colorado seeks to compel just the sort of speech that it tacitly concedes lies beyond its reach. The State stresses that Ms. Smith offers her speech for pay and does so through Creative LLC, a company in which she is “the sole member-owner.” But many of the world's great works of literature and art were created with an expectation of compensation. And speakers do not shed their First Amendment protections by employing the corpo- rate form to disseminate their speech. Colorado urges the Court to look at the reason Ms. Smith refuses to offer the speech it seeks to compel, and it claims that the reason is that she objects to the “protected characteristics” of certain customers. But the parties' stipulations state, to the contrary, that Ms. Smith will gladly conduct business with those having protected characteristics so long as the custom graphics Cite as: U. S. () Syllabus and websites she is asked to create do not violate her beliefs. Ms. Smith stresses that she does not create expressions that defy any of her beliefs for any customer, whether that involves encouraging vio- lence, demeaning another person, or promoting views inconsistent with her religious commitments. The First Amendment's protections belong to all, not just to speakers whose motives the government fnds worthy. In this case, Colorado seeks to force an individual to speak in ways that align with its views but defy her conscience about a matter of major signifcance. In the past, other States in Barnette, Hurley, and Dale have similarly tested the First Amendment's boundaries by seeking to compel speech they thought vital at the time. But abiding the Constitution's commitment to the freedom of speech means all will encounter ideas that are “mis- guided, or even hurtful.” Hurley, U. S., at . Consistent with the First Amendment, the Nation's answer is tolerance, not coercion. The First Amendment envisions the United States as a rich and complex place where all persons are free to think and speak as they wish, not as the government demands. Colorado cannot deny that promise consist- ent with the First Amendment. Pp. –, –. F. th , reversed. Gorsuch, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Roberts, C.

ELENIS Opinion of the Court While Ms. Smith has laid the groundwork for her new ven- ture, she has yet to carry out her plans. She worries that, if she does so, Colorado will force her to express views with which she disagrees. Ms. Smith provides her website and graphic services to customers regardless of their race, creed, sex, or sexual orientation. Id., at a. But she has never created expressions that contradict her own views for any- one—whether that means generating works that encourage violence, demean another person, or defy her religious be- liefs by, say, promoting atheism. See ibid.; see also Tr. of Oral Arg. –. Ms. Smith does not wish to do otherwise now, but she worries Colorado has different plans. Specif- cally, she worries that, if she enters the wedding website business, the State will force her to convey messages incon- sistent with her belief that marriage should be reserved to unions between one man and one woman. App. to Pet. for Cert. a–a. Ms. Smith acknowledges that her views about marriage may not be popular in all quarters. But, she asserts, the First Amendment's Free Speech Clause protects her from being compelled to speak what she does not believe. The Constitution, she insists, protects her right to differ. B To clarify her rights, Ms. Smith fled a lawsuit in federal district court. In that suit, she sought an injunction to pre- vent the State from forcing her to create wedding websites celebrating marriages that defy her beliefs. App. –. To secure relief, Ms. Smith frst had to establish her standing to sue. That required her to show “a credible threat” ex- isted that Colorado would, in fact, seek to compel speech from her that she did not wish to produce. Susan B. An- thony List v. Driehaus, U. S. , (). Toward that end, Ms. Smith began by directing the court to the Colorado Anti-Discrimination Act (CADA). That law defnes a “public accommodation” broadly to include almost Cite as: U. S. () Opinion of the Court every public-facing business in the State. Colo. Rev. Stat. § ––() (). In what some call its “Accommoda- tion Clause,” the law prohibits a public accommodation from denying “the full and equal enjoyment” of its goods and serv- ices to any customer based on his race, creed, disability, sex- ual orientation, or other statutorily enumerated trait. § – –()(a). Either state offcials or private citizens may bring actions to enforce the law. §§ ––, –– (). And a variety of penalties can follow. Courts can order fines up to $ per violation. § ––()(a). The Colorado Commission on Civil Rights can issue cease- and-desist orders, § ––(), and require violators to take various other “affirmative action[s],” §§ ––, ––(). In the past, these have included participation in mandatory educational programs and the submission of ongoing compliance reports to state offcials. See Master- piece Cakeshop, Ltd. v. Colorado Civil Rights Comm'n, U. S. –––, ––– (). In her lawsuit, Ms. Smith alleged that, if she enters the wedding website business to celebrate marriages she does endorse, she faces a credible threat that Colorado will seek to use CADA to compel her to create websites celebrat- ing marriages she does not endorse. F. th , – (CA ). As evidence, Ms. Smith pointed to Colo- In addition to the Accommodation Clause, CADA contains a “Com- munication Clause” that prohibits a public accommodation from “publish- [ing] . . . any written . . . communication” indicating that a person will be denied “the full and equal enjoyment” of services or that he will be “unwelcome, objectionable, unacceptable, or undesirable” based on a pro- tected classifcation. Colo. Rev. Stat. § ––()(a) (). The Com- munication Clause, Ms. Smith notes, prohibits any speech inconsistent with the Accommodation Clause. Because Colorado concedes that its authority to apply the Communication Clause to Ms. Smith stands or falls with its authority to apply the Accommodation Clause, see Brief for Respondents –, we focus our attention on the Accommodation Clause. Page Proof Pending Publication CREATIVE LLC v. ELENIS Opinion of the Court rado's record of past enforcement actions under CADA, including one that worked its way to this Court fve years ago. See Masterpiece Cakeshop, U. S., at –––; see also App. – (discussing Colorado's other past enforcement actions). To facilitate the district court's resolution of the merits of her case, Ms. Smith and the State stipulated to a number of facts: • Ms. Smith is “willing to work with all people regard- less of classifcations such as race, creed, sexual orien- tation, and gender,” and she “will gladly create custom graphics and websites” for clients of any sexual orien- tation. App. to Pet. for Cert. a. • She will not produce content that “contradicts biblical truth” regardless of who orders it. Ibid. • Her belief that marriage is a union between one man and one woman is a sincerely held religious conviction.

() Opinion of the Court • To the extent Ms. Smith may not be able to provide certain services to a potential customer, “[t]here are numerous companies in the State of Colorado and across the nation that offer custom website design services.” Id., at a. C Ultimately, the district court ruled against Ms. Smith. F. Supp. d , (Colo. ). So did the Tenth Cir- cuit. F. th, at . For its part, the Tenth Circuit held that Ms. Smith had standing to sue. In that court's judg- ment, she had established a credible threat that, if she fol- lows through on her plans to offer wedding website services, Colorado will invoke CADA to force her to create speech she does not believe or endorse. Id., at –. The court pointed to the fact that “Colorado has a history of past enforcement against nearly identical conduct—i. e., Master- piece Cakeshop”; that anyone in the State may fle a com- plaint against Ms. Smith and initiate “a potentially burden- some administrative hearing” process; and that “Colorado [has] decline[d] to disavow future enforcement” proceedings against her. Id., at . Before us, no party challenges these conclusions. Turning to the merits, however, the Tenth Circuit held that Ms. Smith was not entitled to the injunction she sought. The court acknowledged that Ms. Smith's planned wedding websites qualify as “pure speech” protected by the First Amendment. Id., at . As a result, the court reasoned, Colorado had to satisfy “strict scrutiny” before compelling speech from her that she did not wish to create. Id., at . Under that standard, the court continued, the State had to show both that forcing Ms. Smith to create speech would serve a compelling governmental interest and that no less restrictive alternative exists to secure that interest. Ibid. Ultimately, a divided panel concluded that the State had car- ried these burdens. As the majority saw it, Colorado has Page Proof Pending Publication CREATIVE LLC v. ELENIS Opinion of the Court a compelling interest in ensuring “equal access to publicly available goods and services,” and no option short of coercing speech from Ms. Smith can satisfy that interest because she plans to offer “unique services” that are, “by defnition, un- available elsewhere.” Id., at – (internal quotation marks omitted). Chief Judge Tymkovich dissented. He observed that “en- suring access to a particular person's” voice, expression, or artistic talent has never qualifed as “a compelling state in- terest” under this Court's precedents. Id., at . Nor, he submitted, should courts depart from those precedents now. “Taken to its logical end,” Chief Judge Tymkovich warned, his colleagues' approach would permit the govern- ment to “regulate the messages communicated by all art- ists”—a result he called “unprecedented.” Id., at . We granted certiorari to review the Tenth Circuit's dispo- sition. U. S. ––– (). II The framers designed the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment to protect the “freedom to think as you will and to speak as you think.” Boy Scouts of America v. Dale, U. S. , – () (internal quotation marks omitted). They did so because they saw the freedom of speech “both as an end and as a means.” Whitney v. California, U. S. , () (Brandeis, J., concurring); see also The Pa- pers of James Madison – (C. Hobson & R. Rutland eds. ). An end because the freedom to think and speak is among our inalienable human rights. See, e. g., Annals of Cong. () (Rep. Madison). A means because the free- dom of thought and speech is “indispensable to the discovery and spread of political truth.” Whitney, U. S., at (Brandeis, J., concurring). By allowing all views to fourish, the framers understood, we may test and improve our own thinking both as individuals and as a Nation. For all these reasons, “[i]f there is any fxed star in our constitutional con- Page Proof Pending Publication Cite as: U. S. () Opinion of the Court stellation,” West Virginia Bd. of Ed. v. Barnette, U. S. , (), it is the principle that the government may not interfere with “an uninhibited marketplace of ideas,” Mc- Cullen v. Coakley, U. S. , () (internal quota- tion marks omitted). From time to time, governments in this country have sought to test these foundational principles. In Barnette, for example, the Court faced an effort by the State of West Virginia to force schoolchildren to salute the Nation's fag and recite the Pledge of Allegiance. If the students refused, the State threatened to expel them and fne or jail their par- ents. Some families objected on the ground that the State sought to compel their children to express views at odds with their faith as Jehovah's Witnesses. When the dispute ar- rived here, this Court offered a frm response. In seeking to compel students to salute the fag and recite a pledge, the Court held, state authorities had “transcend[ed] consti- tutional limitations on their powers.” U. S., at . Their dictates “invade[d] the sphere of intellect and spirit which it is the purpose of the First Amendment . . . to re- serve from all offcial control.” Ibid. A similar story unfolded in Hurley v. Irish-American Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Group of Boston, Inc., U. S. (). There, veterans organizing a St. Patrick's Day pa- rade in Boston refused to include a group of gay, lesbian, and bisexual individuals in their event. The group argued that Massachusetts's public accommodations statute entitled it to participate in the parade as a matter of law. Id., at –. Lower courts agreed. Id., at –. But this Court re- versed. Id., at . Whatever state law may demand, this Court explained, the parade was constitutionally protected speech and requiring the veterans to include voices they wished to exclude would impermissibly require them to “alter the expressive content of their parade.” Id., at – . The veterans' choice of what to say (and not say) might have been unpopular, but they had a First Amendment right Page Proof Pending Publication Page Proof Pending Publication CREATIVE LLC v. ELENIS Opinion of the Court to present their message undiluted by views they did not share. Then there is Boy Scouts of America v. Dale. In that case, the Boy Scouts excluded James Dale, an assistant scoutmaster, from membership after learning he was gay. Mr. Dale argued that New Jersey's public accommodations law required the Scouts to reinstate him. U. S., at – . The New Jersey Supreme Court sided with Mr. Dale, id., at –, but again this Court reversed, id., at . The decision to exclude Mr. Dale may not have implicated pure speech, but this Court held that the Boy Scouts “is an expressive association” entitled to First Amendment protec- tion. Id., at . And, the Court found, forcing the Scouts to include Mr. Dale would “interfere with [its] choice not to propound a point of view contrary to its beliefs.” Id., at . As these cases illustrate, the First Amendment protects an individual's right to speak his mind regardless of whether the government considers his speech sensible and well inten- tioned or deeply “misguided,” Hurley, U. S., at , and likely to cause “anguish” or “incalculable grief,” Snyder v. Phelps, U. S. , (). Equally, the First Amend- ment protects acts of expressive association. See, e. g., Dale, U. S., at –; Hurley, U. S., at –, . Generally, too, the government may not compel a person to speak its own preferred messages. See Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School Dist., U. S. , – (); see also, e. g., Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo, U. S. , (); Wooley v. Maynard, U. S. , (); National Institute of Family and Life Advocates v. Becerra, U. S. –––, ––– () (NIFLA). Nor does it matter whether the government seeks to compel a person to speak its message when he would prefer to re- main silent or to force an individual to include other ideas with his own speech that he would prefer not to include. See Hurley, U. S., at –, ; see also Rumsfeld v. Forum for Academic & Institutional Rights, Inc., U. S. Cite as: U. S. () Opinion of the Court , – () (FAIR) (discussing cases). All that offends the First Amendment just the same. III Applying these principles to this case, we align ourselves with much of the Tenth Circuit's analysis. The Tenth Cir- cuit held that the wedding websites Ms. Smith seeks to cre- ate qualify as “pure speech” under this Court's precedents. F. th, at . We agree. It is a conclusion that fows directly from the parties' stipulations. They have stipulated that Ms. Smith's websites promise to contain “images, words, symbols, and other modes of expression.” App. to Pet. for Cert. a. They have stipulated that every website will be her “original, customized” creation. Id., at a–a. And they have stipulated that Ms. Smith will create these websites to communicate ideas—namely, to “celebrate and promote the couple's wedding and unique love story” and to “celebrat[e] and promot[e]” what Ms. Smith understands to be a true marriage. Id., at a–a. A hundred years ago, Ms. Smith might have furnished her services using pen and paper. Those services are no less protected speech today because they are conveyed with a “voice that resonates farther than it could from any soap- box.” Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union, U. S. , (). All manner of speech—from “pictures, flms, paintings, drawings, and engravings,” to “oral utter- ance and the printed word”—qualify for the First Amend- ment's protections; no less can hold true when it comes to speech like Ms. Smith's conveyed over the Internet. Kaplan v. California, U. S. , – (); see also Shurtleff v. Boston, U. S. –––, ––– – ––– () (fags); Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Assn., U. S. , () (video games); Hurley, U. S., at – (parades); Ward v. Rock Against Racism, U. S. , () (music); Joseph Burstyn, Inc. v. Wilson, U. S. , – () (movies). Page Proof Pending Publication CREATIVE LLC v. ELENIS Opinion of the Court We further agree with the Tenth Circuit that the wedding websites Ms. Smith seeks to create involve her speech. F. th, at , and n. . Again, the parties' stipulations lead the way to that conclusion. See App. to Pet. for Cert. a, a. As the parties have described it, Ms. Smith intends to “ve[t]” each prospective project to determine whether it is one she is willing to endorse. Id., at a. She will con- sult with clients to discuss “their unique stories as source material.” Id., at a. And she will produce a fnal story for each couple using her own words and her own “original artwork.” Id., at a–a. Of course, Ms. Smith's speech may combine with the couple's in the fnal product. But for purposes of the First Amendment that changes nothing. An individual “does not forfeit constitutional protection simply by combining multifarious voices” in a single communication. Hurley, U. S., at . As surely as Ms. Smith seeks to engage in protected First Amendment speech, Colorado seeks to compel speech Ms. Smith does not wish to provide. As the Tenth Circuit observed, if Ms. Smith offers wedding websites celebrating marriages she endorses, the State intends to “forc[e her] to create custom websites” celebrating other marriages she does not. F. th, at . Colorado seeks to compel this speech in order to “excis[e] certain ideas or viewpoints from the public dialogue.” Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, U. S. , (). Indeed, the Tenth Circuit recognized that the coercive “[e]liminati[on]” of dissenting “ideas” about marriage constitutes Colorado's “very pur- pose” in seeking to apply its law to Ms. Smith. F. th, at . We part ways with the Tenth Circuit only when it comes to the legal conclusions that follow. While that court thought Colorado could compel speech from Ms. Smith consistent with the Constitution, our First Amendment precedents laid out above teach otherwise. In Hurley, the Court found that Massachusetts impermissibly compelled speech in violation Page Proof Pending Publication Cite as: U. S. () Opinion of the Court of the First Amendment when it sought to force parade orga- nizers to accept participants who would “affec[t] the[ir] mes- sage.” U. S., at . In Dale, the Court held that New Jersey intruded on the Boy Scouts' First Amendment rights when it tried to require the group to “propound a point of view contrary to its beliefs” by directing its membership choices. U. S., at . And in Barnette, this Court found impermissible coercion when West Virginia required schoolchildren to recite a pledge that contravened their con- victions on threat of punishment or expulsion. U. S., at –. Here, Colorado seeks to put Ms. Smith to a similar choice: If she wishes to speak, she must either speak as the State demands or face sanctions for expressing her own be- liefs, sanctions that may include compulsory participation in “remedial . . . training,” fling periodic compliance reports as offcials deem necessary, and paying monetary fnes. App. ; supra, at –. Under our precedents, that “is enough,” more than enough, to represent an impermissible abridgment of the First Amendment's right to speak freely. Hurley, U. S., at . Consider what a contrary approach would mean. Under Colorado's logic, the government may compel anyone who speaks for pay on a given topic to accept all commissions on that same topic—no matter the underlying message—if the topic somehow implicates a customer's statutorily protected trait. F. th, at (Tymkovich, C. J., dissenting). Taken seriously, that principle would allow the government to force all manner of artists, speechwriters, and others whose services involve speech to speak what they do not believe on pain of penalty. The government could require “an unwilling Muslim movie director to make a flm with a Zionist message,” or “an atheist muralist to accept a commis- sion celebrating Evangelical zeal,” so long as they would make flms or murals for other members of the public with different messages. Id., at . Equally, the government could force a male website designer married to another man Page Proof Pending Publication CREATIVE LLC v. ELENIS Opinion of the Court to design websites for an organization that advocates against same-sex marriage. See Brief for Petitioners –. Countless other creative professionals, too, could be forced to choose between remaining silent, producing speech that violates their beliefs, or speaking their minds and incurring sanctions for doing so. See, e. g., Brief for Creative Profes- sionals et al. as Amici Curiae –; Brief for First Amend- ment Scholars as Amici Curiae –. As our precedents recognize, the First Amendment tolerates none of that. In saying this much, we do not question the vital role pub- lic accommodations laws play in realizing the civil rights of all Americans. This Court has recognized that govern- ments in this country have a “compelling interest” in elimi- nating discrimination in places of public accommodation. Roberts v. United States Jaycees, U. S. , (); see also Hurley, U. S., at –. This Court has recognized, too, that public accommodations laws “vindi- cate the deprivation of personal dignity that surely accompa- nies denials of equal access to public establishments.” Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v. United States, U. S. , () (internal quotation marks omitted); see also, e. g., Katzenbach v. McClung, U. S. (); Newman v. Piggie Park Enterprises, Inc., U. S. () (per curiam). Over time, governments in this country have expanded public accommodations laws in notable ways too. Statutes like Colorado's grow from nondiscrimination rules the com- mon law sometimes imposed on common carriers and places of traditional public accommodation like hotels and restau- rants. Dale, U. S., at –. Often, these enter- prises exercised something like monopoly power or hosted or transported others or their belongings much like bailees. See, e. g., Liverpool & Great Western Steam Co. v. Phenix Ins. Co., U. S. , (); Primrose v. Western Union Telegraph Co., U. S. , (). Over time, some States, Colorado included, have expanded the reach of these Page Proof Pending Publication Cite as: U. S. () Opinion of the Court nondiscrimination rules to cover virtually every place of business engaged in any sales to the public. Compare Colo. Sess. Laws pp. – (a short list of entities origi- nally bound by the State's public accommodations law) with Colo. Rev. Stat. § ––() (currently defning a public accommodation to include “any place of business engaged in any sales to the public”). Importantly, States have also expanded their laws to pro- hibit more forms of discrimination. Today, for example, ap- proximately half the States have laws like Colorado's that expressly prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual ori- entation. And, as we have recognized, this is entirely “un- exceptional.” Masterpiece Cakeshop, U. S., at –––. States may “protect gay persons, just as [they] can protect other classes of individuals, in acquiring whatever products and services they choose on the same terms and conditions as are offered to other members of the public. And there are no doubt innumerable goods and services that no one could argue implicate the First Amendment.” Ibid.; see also Hurley, U. S., at –; F. th, at (Tymkov- ich, C. J., dissenting). Consistent with all of this, Ms. Smith herself recognizes that Colorado and other States are gener- ally free to apply their public accommodations laws, includ- Besides Colorado, this includes Cal. Civ. Code Ann. § (West ); Conn. Gen. Stat. § a–d (); Del. Code Ann., Tit. , § (); Haw. Rev. Stat. § – (Cum. Supp. ); Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. , § /– (West ); Iowa Code § . (); Me. Rev. Stat.

Page Proof Pending Publication CREATIVE LLC v. ELENIS Opinion of the Court ing their provisions protecting gay persons, to a vast array of businesses. Reply Brief ; see Tr. of Oral Arg. –. At the same time, this Court has also recognized that no public accommodations law is immune from the demands of the Constitution. In particular, this Court has held, public accommodations statutes can sweep too broadly when de- ployed to compel speech. In Hurley, the Court commented favorably on Massachusetts's public accommodations law, but made plain it could not be “applied to expressive activity” to compel speech. U. S., at , . In Dale, the Court observed that New Jersey's public accommodations law had many lawful applications but held that it could “not justify such a severe intrusion on the Boy Scouts' rights to freedom of expressive association.” U. S., at . And, once more, what was true in those cases must hold true here. When a state public accommodations law and the Constitu- tion collide, there can be no question which must prevail. U. S. Const., Art. VI, cl. . Nor is it any answer, as the Tenth Circuit seemed to sup- pose, that Ms. Smith's services are “unique.” F. th, at . In some sense, of course, her voice is unique; so is everyone's. But that hardly means a State may coopt an individual's voice for its own purposes. In Hurley, the vet- erans had an “enviable” outlet for speech; after all, their pa- rade was a notable and singular event. U. S., at , –. In Dale, the Boy Scouts offered what some might consider a unique experience. U. S., at –. But in both cases this Court held that the State could not use its public accommodations statute to deny speakers the right “to choose the content of [their] own message[s].” Hurley, U. S., at ; see Dale, U. S., at –. Were the rule otherwise, the better the artist, the fner the writer, the more unique his talent, the more easily his voice could be conscripted to disseminate the government's preferred mes- sages. That would not respect the First Amendment; more nearly, it would spell its demise. Page Proof Pending Publication Cite as: U. S. () Opinion of the Court IV Before us, Colorado appears to distance itself from the Tenth Circuit's reasoning. Now, the State seems to ac- knowledge that the First Amendment does forbid it from co- ercing Ms. Smith to create websites endorsing same-sex mar- riage or expressing any other message with which she disagrees. See Brief for Respondents (disclaiming any interest in “interfer[ing] with [Ms. Smith's] choice to offer only websites of [her] own design”); see also Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae (conceding that “constitutional concerns” would arise if Colorado “require[d] petitione[r] to design a website” that she “would not create or convey for any client”). Instead, Colorado devotes most of its efforts to advancing an alternative theory for affrmance. The State's alternative theory runs this way. To comply with Colorado law, the State says, all Ms. Smith must do is repurpose websites she will create to celebrate marriages she does endorse for marriages she does not. She sells a product to some, the State reasons, so she must sell the same product to all. Brief for Respondents , . At bottom, Colorado's theory rests on a belief that the Tenth Circuit erred at the outset when it said this case implicates pure speech. Id., at . Instead, Colorado says, this case in- volves only the sale of an ordinary commercial product and any burden on Ms. Smith's speech is purely “incidental.” Id., at , –; see Tr. of Oral Arg. , –. On the State's telling, then, speech more or less vanishes from the picture—and, with it, any need for First Amendment scru- tiny. In places, the dissent seems to advance the same line of argument. Post, at – (opinion of Sotomayor, J.). This alternative theory, however, is diffcult to square with the parties' stipulations. As we have seen, the State has stipulated that Ms. Smith does not seek to sell an ordinary commercial good but intends to create “customized and tai- lored” speech for each couple. App. to Pet. for Cert. a, a. The State has stipulated that “[e]ach website Cre- Page Proof Pending Publication CREATIVE LLC v. ELENIS Opinion of the Court ative designs and creates is an original, customized creation for each client.” Id., at a. The State has stipulated, too, that Ms. Smith's wedding websites “will be expressive in na- ture, using text, graphics, and in some cases videos to cele- brate and promote the couple's wedding and unique love story.” Id., at a. As the case comes to us, then, Colo- rado seeks to compel just the sort of speech that it tacitly concedes lies beyond the reach of its powers. Of course, as the State emphasizes, Ms. Smith offers her speech for pay and does so through Creative LLC, a com- pany in which she is “the sole member-owner.” Id., at a; see also post, at (opinion of Sotomayor, J.) (emphasizing Ms. Smith's “commercial” activity). But none of that makes a difference. Does anyone think a speechwriter loses his First Amendment right to choose for whom he works if he accepts money in return? Or that a visual artist who ac- cepts commissions from the public does the same? Many of the world's great works of literature and art were created with an expectation of compensation. Nor, this Court has held, do speakers shed their First Amendment protections by employing the corporate form to disseminate their speech. This fact underlies our cases involving everything from movie producers to book publishers to newspapers. See, e. g., Joseph Burstyn, Inc., U. S., at –; Simon & Schuster, Inc. v. Members of N. Y. State Crime Victims Bd., U. S. , – (); Grosjean v. Amer- ican Press Co., U. S. , –, (). Colorado next urges us to focus on the reason Ms. Smith refuses to offer the speech it seeks to compel. She refuses, the State insists, because she objects to the “protected char- acteristics” of certain customers. Brief for Respondents ; see also post, at –, (opinion of Sotomayor, J.) (re- citing the same argument). But once more, the parties' stip- ulations speak differently. The parties agree that Ms. Smith “will gladly create custom graphics and websites for gay, les- bian, or bisexual clients or for organizations run by gay, Page Proof Pending Publication Cite as: U. S. () Opinion of the Court lesbian, or bisexual persons so long as the custom graphics and websites” do not violate her beliefs. App. to Pet. for Cert. a. That is a condition, the parties acknowledge, Ms. Smith applies to “all customers.” Ibid. Ms. Smith stresses, too, that she has not and will not create expressions that defy any of her beliefs for any customer, whether that involves encouraging violence, demeaning another person, or promoting views inconsistent with her religious commit- ments. See Tr. of Oral Arg. –. Nor, in any event, do the First Amendment's protections belong only to speakers whose motives the government fnds worthy; its protections belong to all, including to speakers whose motives others may fnd misinformed or offensive. See Federal Election Comm'n v. Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc., U. S. , – () (opinion of Roberts, C. J.) (observing that “a speaker's motivation is entirely irrelevant” (internal quota- tion marks omitted)); National Socialist Party of America v. Skokie, U. S. , – () (per curiam) (upholding free-speech rights of participants in a Nazi parade); Snyder, U. S., at – (same for protestors of a soldier's funeral). The dissent labels the distinction between status and message “amus- ing” and “embarrassing.” Post, at . But in doing so, the dissent ig- nores a fundamental feature of the Free Speech Clause. While it does not protect status-based discrimination unrelated to expression, generally it does protect a speaker's right to control her own message—even when we may disapprove of the speaker's motive or the message itself. The dissent's derision is no answer to any of this. It ignores, too, the fact that Colorado itself has, in other contexts, distinguished status-based discrimi- nation (forbidden) from the right of a speaker to control his own message (protected). See App. , , , –, , , . (Truth be told, even the dissent acknowledges “th[is] distinction” elsewhere in its opinion. Post, at , n. .) Nor is the distinction unusual in societies committed both to nondiscrimination rules and free expression. See, e. g., Lee v. Ashers Baking Co. Ltd., [] UKSC , p. (“The less favourable treatment was afforded to the message not to the man”). Does the dis- sent really fnd all that amusing and embarrassing? Page Proof Pending Publication Page Proof Pending Publication CREATIVE LLC v. ELENIS Opinion of the Court Failing all else, Colorado suggests that this Court's deci- sion in FAIR supports affrmance. See also post, at – (opinion of Sotomayor, J.) (making the same argument). In FAIR, a group of schools challenged a law requiring them, as a condition of accepting federal funds, to permit military recruiters space on campus on equal terms with other poten- tial employers. U. S., at –, . The only expres- sive activity required of the law schools, the Court found, involved the posting of logistical notices along these lines: “ `The U. S. Army recruiter will meet interested students in Room at a.m.' ” Id., at –. And, the Court rea- soned, compelled speech of this sort was “incidental” and a “far cry” from the speech at issue in our “leading First Amendment precedents [that] have established the principle that freedom of speech prohibits the government from telling people what they must say.” Ibid.; see also NIFLA, U. S., at –––. It is a far cry from this case too. To be sure, our cases have held that the government may sometimes “requir[e] the dissemination of purely factual and uncontroversial informa- tion,” particularly in the context of “commercial advertis- ing.” Hurley, U. S., at (internal quotation marks omitted); see also NIFLA, U. S., at –––; Riley v. Na- tional Federation of Blind of N. C., Inc., U. S. , – (). But this case involves nothing like that. Here, Colorado does not seek to impose an incidental burden on speech. It seeks to force an individual to “utter what is not in [her] mind” about a question of political and religious sig- nifcance. Barnette, U. S., at . And that, FAIR reaffrmed, is something the First Amendment does not tol- erate. No government, FAIR recognized, may affect a “speaker's message” by “forc[ing]” her to “accommodate” other views, U. S., at ; no government may “ `alter' ” the “ `expressive content' ” of her message, id., at – (al- teration omitted); and no government may “interfer[e] with” her “desired message,” id., at . Cite as: U. S. () Opinion of the Court V It is diffcult to read the dissent and conclude we are look- ing at the same case. Much of it focuses on the evolution of public accommodations laws, post, at –, and the strides gay Americans have made toward securing equal justice under law, post, at –. And, no doubt, there is much to applaud here. But none of this answers the question we face today: Can a State force someone who provides her own expressive services to abandon her conscience and speak its preferred message instead? When the dissent fnally gets around to that question— more than halfway into its opinion—it reimagines the facts of this case from top to bottom. The dissent claims that Colorado wishes to regulate Ms. Smith's “conduct,” not her speech. Post, at –. Forget Colorado's stipulation that Ms. Smith's activities are “expressive,” App. to Pet. for Cert. a, and the Tenth Circuit's conclusion that the State seeks to compel “pure speech,” F. th, at .

But it ignores the Tenth Circuit's fnding that Ms. Smith faces a credible threat of sanctions unless she con- forms her views to the State's. F. th, at –. The dissent suggests (over and over again) that any burden on speech here is “incidental.” Post, at , –, –. All despite the Tenth Circuit's fnding that Colorado intends to force Ms. Smith to convey a message she does not believe with the “very purpose” of “[e]liminating . . . ideas” that dif- fer from its own.

It claims that, “for the frst time in its history,” the Court “grants a business open to the public” a “right to refuse to serve mem- bers of a protected class.” Post, at ; see also post, at , Perplexingly, too, the dissent suggests that, by recounting the Tenth Circuit's conclusion on this score, we “misunderstan[d] this case” and “in- vo[ke] . . . Orwellian thought policing.” Post, at , n. . Page Proof Pending Publication CREATIVE LLC v. ELENIS Opinion of the Court n. , –. Never mind that we do no such thing and Colorado itself has stipulated Ms. Smith will (as CADA re- quires) “work with all people regardless of . . . sexual orien- tation.” App. to Pet. for Cert. a. Never mind, too, that it is the dissent that would have this Court do something truly novel by allowing a government to coerce an individual to speak contrary to her beliefs on a signifcant issue of per- sonal conviction, all in order to eliminate ideas that differ from its own. There is still more. The dissent asserts that we “sweep under the rug petitioners' challenge to CADA's Communica- tion Clause.” Post, at . This despite the fact the parties and the Tenth Circuit recognized that Ms. Smith's Communi- cation Clause challenge hinges on her Accommodation Clause challenge. (So much so that Colorado devoted less than two pages at the tail end of its brief to the Communication Clause and the Tenth Circuit afforded it just three paragraphs in its free-speech analysis. See Brief for Respondents –; F. th, at –.) The dissent even suggests that our decision today is akin to endorsing a “separate but equal” regime that would allow law frms to refuse women admis- sion into partnership, restaurants to deny service to Black Americans, or businesses seeking employees to post some- thing like a “White Applicants Only” sign. Post, at , – , –, , , and n. , –. Pure fction all. Why does the dissent try to refocus this case around the Communica- tion Clause? Perhaps because the moment one acknowledges the parties' stipulations—and the fact Colorado seeks to use its Accommodation Clause to compel speech in order to ensure conformity to its own views on a topic of major signifcance—the First Amendment implications become obvious. As does the fact that our case is nothing like a typical application of a public accommodations law requiring an ordinary, non-expressive business to serve all customers or consider all applicants. Our decision today does not concern—much less endorse—anything like the “ `straight couples only' ” notices the dissent conjures out of thin air. Post, at , n. . Nor do the parties discuss anything of the sort in their stipulations. Page Proof Pending Publication Page Proof Pending Publication Cite as: U. S. () Opinion of the Court In some places, the dissent gets so turned around about the facts that it opens fre on its own position. For instance: While stressing that a Colorado company cannot refuse “the full and equal enjoyment of [its] services” based on a custom- er's protected status, post, at , the dissent assures us that a company selling creative services “to the public” does have a right “to decide what messages to include or not to in- clude,” post, at . But if that is true, what are we even debating? Instead of addressing the parties' stipulations about the case actually before us, the dissent spends much of its time adrift on a sea of hypotheticals about photographers, statio- ners, and others, asking if they too provide expressive serv- ices covered by the First Amendment. Post, at –, –, –. But those cases are not this case. Doubtless, determining what qualifes as expressive activity protected by the First Amendment can sometimes raise dif- fcult questions. But this case presents no complication of that kind. The parties have stipulated that Ms. Smith seeks to engage in expressive activity. And the Tenth Circuit has recognized her services involve “pure speech.” See supra, at , . Nothing the dissent says can alter this—nor can it displace the First Amendment protections that follow. The dissent's treatment of precedent parallels its handling of the facts. Take its remarkable suggestion that a govern- ment forcing an individual to create speech on weighty issues with which she disagrees—all, as the Tenth Circuit found, with the goal of “[e]liminating” views it does not share, F. th, at —only “incidental[ly]” burdens First Amend- ment liberties. Post, at –. Far from embracing a no- tion like that, our cases have rejected it time after time— including in the context of public accommodations laws. See Parts II–IV, supra; FAIR, U. S., at – (no govern- ment may affect a “speaker's own message” by “forc[ing]” her to “accommodate” views she does not hold); Hurley, CREATIVE LLC v. ELENIS Opinion of the Court U. S., at , (using a public accommodations law to com- pel parade organizers to include speech they did not believe was no mere “ `incidental' ” infringement on First Amend- ment rights); Dale, U. S., at (employing a public ac- commodations law to require the Boy Scouts to alter their admissions policies had more than “an incidental effect on protected speech”). When it fnally gets around to discussing these controlling precedents, the dissent offers a wholly unpersuasive attempt to distinguish them. The First Amendment protections fur- nished in Barnette, Hurley, and Dale, the dissent declares, were limited to schoolchildren and “nonproft[s],” and it is “dispiriting” to think they might also apply to Ms. Smith's “commercial” activity. Post, at –. But our prece- dents endorse nothing like the limits the dissent would project on them. Instead, as we have seen, the First Amendment ex- tends to all persons engaged in expressive conduct, including those who seek proft (such as speechwriters, artists, and website designers). See supra, at . If anything is truly dispiriting here, it is the dissent's failure to take seri- ously this Court's enduring commitment to protecting the The dissent observes that public accommodations laws may some- times touch on speech incidentally as they work to ensure ordinary, non- expressive goods and services are sold on equal terms. Cf. post, at – (citing Sorrell v. IMS Health Inc., U. S. (); Rumsfeld v. FAIR, U. S. (); United States v. O'Brien, U. S. ()). But as Hurley observed, there is nothing “incidental” about an infringe- ment on speech when a public accommodations law is applied “peculiar[ly]” to compel expressive activity. Hurley v. Irish-American Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Group of Boston, Inc., U. S. , ().

Post, at – (citing Hishon v. King & Spalding, U. S. (); Roberts v. United States Jaycees, U. S. ()). But the dissent disregards Dale's holding that context matters and that very different considerations come into play when a law is used to force individuals to toe the government's preferred line when speaking (or associating to express themselves) on matters of signifcance. Boy Scouts of America v. Dale, U. S. , – (). Page Proof Pending Publication Cite as: U. S. () Opinion of the Court speech rights of all comers, no matter how controversial—or even repugnant—many may fnd the message at hand. Finally, the dissent comes out and says what it really means: Once Ms. Smith offers some speech, Colorado “would require [her] to create and sell speech, notwithstand- ing [her] sincere objection to doing so”—and the dissent would force her to comply with that demand. Post, at . Even as it does so, however, the dissent refuses to acknowl- edge where its reasoning leads. In a world like that, as Chief Judge Tymkovich highlighted, governments could force “an unwilling Muslim movie director to make a flm with a Zionist message,” they could compel “an atheist mu- ralist to accept a commission celebrating Evangelical zeal,” and they could require a gay website designer to create web- sites for a group advocating against same-sex marriage, so long as these speakers would accept commissions from the public with different messages. F. th, at (dissenting opinion). Perhaps the dissent fnds these possibilities un- troubling because it trusts state governments to coerce only “enlightened” speech. But if that is the calculation, it is a dangerous one indeed. The dissent is right about one thing—“[w]hat a difference” time can make. See post, at (internal quotation marks omitted). Eighty years ago in Barnette, this Court affrmed that “no offcial, high or petty, can prescribe what shall be Perhaps the dissent fnds these possibilities untroubling for another reason. It asserts that CADA does not apply to “[m]any flmmakers, vis- ual artists, and writers” because they do not “hold out” their services to the public. Post, at . But the dissent cites nothing to support its claim and instead, once more, fghts the facts. As we have seen, Colora- do's law today applies to “any place of business engaged in any sales to the public.” Colo. Rev. Stat. §––() (emphasis added); see also Part III, supra.

And just days ago, Members of today's dissent joined in holding that the First Amendment restricts how States may prosecute stalkers de- spite the “harm[ful],” “low-value,” and “upsetting” nature of their speech. Counterman v. Colorado, U. S. , (); id., at – (Sotomayor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).

By approving a government's effort to “[e]liminat[e]” disfavored “ideas,” F. th, at , today's dissent is emblematic of an unfortunate tendency by some to defend First Amendment values only when they fnd the speaker's message sympathetic. But “[i]f liberty means anything at all, it means the right to tell people what they do not want to hear.” Id., at (Tymkovich, C. J., dissenting) (quoting G. Orwell). * In this case, Colorado seeks to force an individual to speak in ways that align with its views but defy her conscience Page Proof Pending Publication Cite as: U. S. () Sotomayor, J., dissenting about a matter of major signifcance. In the past, other States in Barnette, Hurley, and Dale have similarly tested the First Amendment's boundaries by seeking to compel speech they thought vital at the time. But, as this Court has long held, the opportunity to think for ourselves and to express those thoughts freely is among our most cherished liberties and part of what keeps our Republic strong. Of course, abiding the Constitution's commitment to the free- dom of speech means all of us will encounter ideas we con- sider “unattractive,” post, at (opinion of Sotomayor, J.), “misguided, or even hurtful,” Hurley, U. S., at . But tolerance, not coercion, is our Nation's answer. The First Amendment envisions the United States as a rich and com- plex place where all persons are free to think and speak as they wish, not as the government demands. Because Colo- rado seeks to deny that promise, the judgment is Reversed. Justice Sotomayor, with whom Justice Kagan and Justice Jackson join, dissenting. Five years ago, this Court recognized the “general rule” that religious and philosophical objections to gay marriage “do not allow business owners and other actors in the econ- omy and in society to deny protected persons equal access to goods and services under a neutral and generally applicable public accommodations law.” Masterpiece Cakeshop, Ltd. v. Colorado Civil Rights Comm'n, U. S. –––, ––– (). The Court also recognized the “serious stigma” that would result if “purveyors of goods and services who object to gay marriages for moral and religious reasons” were “allowed to put up signs saying `no goods or services will be sold if they will be used for gay marriages.' ” Id., at –––. Today, the Court, for the frst time in its history, grants a business open to the public a constitutional right to refuse to serve members of a protected class. Specifcally, the Court holds that the First Amendment exempts a website-design Page Proof Pending Publication CREATIVE LLC v. ELENIS Sotomayor, J., dissenting company from a state law that prohibits the company from denying wedding websites to same-sex couples if the com- pany chooses to sell those websites to the public. The Court also holds that the company has a right to post a notice that says, “ `no [wedding websites] will be sold if they will be used for gay marriages.' ” Ibid. “What a difference fve years makes.” Carson v. Makin, U. S. –––, ––– () (Sotomayor, J., dissenting). And not just at the Court. Around the country, there has been a backlash to the movement for liberty and equality for gen- der and sexual minorities. New forms of inclusion have been met with reactionary exclusion. This is heartbreaking. Sadly, it is also familiar. When the civil rights and women's rights movements sought equality in public life, some public establishments refused. Some even claimed, based on sin- cere religious beliefs, constitutional rights to discriminate. The brave Justices who once sat on this Court decisively re- jected those claims. Now the Court faces a similar test. A business open to the public seeks to deny gay and lesbian customers the full and equal enjoyment of its services based on the owner's religious belief that same-sex marriages are “false.” The business ar- gues, and a majority of the Court agrees, that because the busi- ness offers services that are customized and expressive, the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment shields the busi- ness from a generally applicable law that prohibits discrimina- tion in the sale of publicly available goods and services. That is wrong. Profoundly wrong. As I will explain, the law in question targets conduct, not speech, for regulation, and the act of discrimination has never constituted protected expres- sion under the First Amendment. Our Constitution contains no right to refuse service to a disfavored group. I dissent. I A A “public accommodations law” is a law that guarantees to every person the full and equal enjoyment of places of public Page Proof Pending Publication Page Proof Pending Publication Cite as: U. S. () Sotomayor, J., dissenting accommodation without unjust discrimination. The Ameri- can people, through their elected representatives, have enacted such laws at all levels of government: The federal Civil Rights Act of and the Americans with Disabilities Act of prohibit discrimination by places of public accom- modation on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, or disability. All but fve States have analogous laws that prohibit discrimination on the basis of these and other traits, such as age, sex, sexual orientation, and gender identity. And numerous local laws offer similar protections. The people of Colorado have adopted the Colorado Anti- Discrimination Act (CADA), which provides: See U. S. C. § a et seq.

ELENIS Sotomayor, J., dissenting “It is a discriminatory practice and unlawful for a per- son, directly or indirectly, to refuse, withhold from, or deny to an individual or a group, because of disability, race, creed, color, sex, sexual orientation, gender iden- tity, gender expression, marital status, national origin, or ancestry, the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommo- dations of a place of public accommodation.” Colo. Rev. Stat. § ––()(a). This provision, known as the Act's “Accommodation Clause,” applies to any business engaged in sales “to the public.” § ––(). The Accommodation Clause does not apply to any “church, synagogue, mosque, or other place that is principally used for religious purposes.” Ibid. In addition, CADA contains what is referred to as the Act's “Communication Clause,” which makes it unlawful to advertise that services “will be refused, withheld from, or denied,” or that an individual is “unwelcome” at a place of public accommodation, based on the same protected traits. § ––()(a). In other words, just as a business open to the public may not refuse to serve customers based on race, religion, or sexual orientation, so too the business may not hang a sign that says, “No Blacks, No Muslims, No Gays.” A public accommodations law has two core purposes. First, the law ensures “equal access to publicly available goods and services.” Roberts v. United States Jaycees, U. S. , () (emphasis added). For social groups that face discrimination, such access is vital. All the more so if the group is small in number or if discrimination against the group is widespread. Equal access is mutually bene- fcial: Protected persons receive “equally effective and mean- ingful opportunity to beneft from all aspects of life in America,” Cong. Rec. () (remarks of Sen. Harkin) (Americans with Disabilities Act), and “society,” in return, receives “the benefts of wide participation in Page Proof Pending Publication Cite as: U. S. () Sotomayor, J., dissenting political, economic, and cultural life.” Roberts, U. S., at . Second, a public accommodations law ensures equal dig- nity in the common market. Indeed, that is the law's “fun- damental object”: “to vindicate `the deprivation of personal dignity that surely accompanies denials of equal access to public establishments.' ” Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v. United States, U. S. , () (quoting S. Rep. No. , th Cong., d Sess., ()). This purpose does not depend on whether goods or services are otherwise avail- able. “ `Discrimination is not simply dollars and cents, ham- burgers and movies; it is the humiliation, frustration, and embarrassment that a person must surely feel when he is told that he is unacceptable as a member of the public be- cause of his [social identity]. It is equally the inability to explain to a child that regardless of education, civility, cour- tesy, and morality he will be denied the right to enjoy equal treatment.' ” U. S., at (Goldberg, J., concurring). When a young Jewish girl and her parents come across a business with a sign out front that says, “ `No dogs or Jews allowed,' ” the fact that another business might serve her family does not redress that “stigmatizing injury,” Roberts, U. S., at . Or, put another way, “the hardship Jackie Robinson suffered when on the road” with his baseball team “was not an inability to fnd some hotel that would have him; it was the indignity of not being allowed to stay in the same hotel as his white teammates.” J. Oleske, The Evolution of Accommodation, Harv. Civ. Rights-Civ. Lib. L. Rev. , (). To illustrate, imagine a funeral home in rural Mississippi agrees to transport and cremate the body of an elderly man who has passed away, and to host a memorial lunch.

See First Amended Complaint in Zawadski v. Brewer Fu- neral Services, Inc., No. CI––cv– (C. C. Pearl River Cty., Miss., Mar. , ), pp. –. This ostracism, this otherness, is among the most distressing feelings that can be felt by our social species. K. Williams, Ostracism, Ann. Rev. Psychology , – (). Preventing the “unique evils” caused by “acts of invidious discrimination in the distribution of publicly available goods, services, and other advantages” is a compelling state interest “of the highest order.” Roberts, U. S., at , ; see Board of Directors of Rotary Int'l v. Rotary Club of Duarte, U. S. , (). Moreover, a law that prohibits only such acts by businesses open to the public is narrowly tailored to achieve that compelling interest. The law “re- sponds precisely to the substantive problem which legiti- mately concerns the State”: the harm from status-based dis- crimination in the public marketplace. Roberts, U. S., at (internal quotation marks omitted). This last aspect of a public accommodations law deserves special emphasis: The law regulates only businesses that choose to sell goods or services “to the general public,” e. g., Va. Code Ann. §.–, or “to the public,” e. g., Mich. The men in this story are Robert “Bob” Huskey and John “Jack” Za- wadski. Bob and Jack were a loving couple of years. They moved from California to Colorado to care for Bob's mother, then to Wisconsin to farm apples and teach special education, and then to Mississippi to retire. Within weeks of this Court's decision in Obergefell v. Hodges, U. S. (), Bob and Jack got married. They were and years old on their wedding day. A few months later, Bob's health took a turn. He died the following spring. When Bob's family was forced to fnd an alter- native funeral home more than an hour from where Bob and Jack lived, the lunch in Bob's memory had to be canceled. Jack died the next year. Page Proof Pending Publication Cite as: U. S. () Sotomayor, J., dissenting Comp. Laws § .. Some public accommodations laws, such as the federal Civil Rights Act, list establishments that qualify, but these establishments are ones open to the public generally. See, e. g., U. S. C. § a(b) (hotels, restau- rants, gas stations, movie theaters, concert halls, sports are- nas, stadiums). A public accommodations law does not force anyone to start a business, or to hold out the business's goods or services to the public at large. The law also does not compel any business to sell any particular good or service. But if a business chooses to proft from the public market, which is established and maintained by the state, the state may require the business to abide by a legal norm of non- discrimination. In particular, the state may ensure that groups historically marked for second-class status are not denied goods or services on equal terms. The concept of a public accommodation thus embodies a simple, but powerful, social contract: A business that chooses to sell to the public assumes a duty to serve the public without unjust discrimination. J. Singer, No Right To Ex- clude: Public Accommodations and Private Property, Nw. U. L. Rev. , () (Singer). B The legal duty of a business open to the public to serve the public without unjust discrimination is deeply rooted in our history. The true power of this principle, however, lies in its capacity to evolve, as society comes to understand more forms of unjust discrimination and, hence, to include more persons as full and equal members of “the public.” “At common law, innkeepers, smiths, and others who `made profession of a public employment,' were prohibited from re- fusing, without good reason, to serve a customer.” Hurley v. Irish-American Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Group of Bos- ton, Inc., U. S. , () (quoting Lane v. Cotton, Page Proof Pending Publication CREATIVE LLC v. ELENIS Sotomayor, J., dissenting Mod. , , Eng. Rep. , (K. B. ) (Holt, C. J.)). “Public employment” meant a business “in which the owner has held himself out as ready to serve the public by exercising his trade.” Singer ; see, e. g., Gisbourn v. Hurst, Salk. , Eng. Rep. (K. B. ). Take, for example, Lane v. Cotton, “[t]he leading English case” on the subject “cited over and over again in the nineteenth century in the United States.” Singer . There, Lord Chief Justice Holt explained: “[W]here-ever any subject takes upon himself a public trust for the beneft of the rest of his fellow-subjects, he is eo ipso bound to serve the subject in all the things that are within the reach and comprehension of such an offce, under pain of an action against him. . . . If on the road a shoe fall off my horse, and I come to a smith to have one put on, and the smith refuse to do it, an action will lie against him, because he has made profession of a trade which is for the public good, and has thereby exposed and vested an interest of himself in all the King's subjects that will employ him in the way of his trade.” Lane v. Cotton, Mod., at , Eng. Rep., at . That is to say, a business's duty to serve all comers derived from its choice to hold itself out as ready to serve the public. This holding-out rationale became frmly established in early American law. See J. Kent, Commentaries on American Law – (); J. Story, Commentaries on the Law of Bailments §§ , (); see also, e. g., Markham v. Brown, N. H. , (); Jencks v. Coleman, F. Cas. , (No. ,) (CC RI ) (Story, J.); Dwight v. Brew- ster, Mass. , (). The majority is therefore mistaken to suggest that public accommodations or common carriers historically assumed duties to serve all comers because they enjoyed monopolies or otherwise had market power. Ante, at . Tellingly, the Page Proof Pending Publication Cite as: U. S. () Sotomayor, J., dissenting majority cites no common-law case espousing the monopoly rationale. That is because nowhere in the relevant case law “is monopoly suggested as the distinguishing characteristic.” E. Adler, Business Jurisprudence, Harv. L. Rev. , () (“A distinction based on monopoly would require proof that the common carrier had some kind of a monopoly which the private carrier did not have, or that `common' was synon- ymous with `monopoly.' The plain meaning of the cases is [instead that] the common was the public, the professional, the business carrier or other trader”). After the Civil War, some States codifed the common-law duty of public accommodations to serve all comers. See M. Konvitz & T. Leskes, A Century of Civil Rights – (). Early state public accommodations statutes prohib- ited discrimination based on race or color. Yet the principle was at times stated more broadly: to provide “a remedy against any unjust discrimination to the citizen in all public places.” Ferguson v. Gies, Mich. , , N. W. , For example, a case on which the majority relies found that it could “shortly dispos[e]” of the question whether a steamship company was a common carrier because the company was “the owner of a general ship, carrying goods for hire . . . and perform[ing]” that service “regular[ly].” Liverpool & Great Western Steam Co. v. Phenix Ins. Co., U. S. , (). No showing of market power was required. Ibid. Nor does “host[ing] or transport[ing] others and their belongings,” ante, at , explain the right of access. Smiths, for instance, did not al- ways practice their trade by holding property for others. And even when they did, any duty of care resulting from such bailment cannot explain the duty to serve all comers, which logically must be assumed beforehand. See Lane v. Cotton, Mod. , , Eng. Rep. , (K. B. ) (Holt, C. J.). That duty instead came from somewhere else, and the weight of authority indicates that it came from a business's act of holding itself out to the public as ready to serve anyone who would hire it.

This Court, however, struck down the federal Civil Rights Act of as unconstitutional. Civil Rights Cases, U. S. , (). Southern States repealed public accom- modations statutes and replaced them with Jim Crow laws. And state courts construed any remaining right of access in ways that furthered de jure and de facto racial segregation. Full and equal enjoyment came to mean “separate but equal” enjoyment. The result of this backsliding was “the replace- ment of a general right of access with a general right to exclude . . . in order to promote a racial caste system.” Singer .

In , two decades after then–Howard University law student Pauli Murray organized sit-ins at cafeterias in Washington, D.

Around the country, similar acts of protest against racial in- justice, some big and some small, sought “to create such a cri- sis and foster such a tension” that the country would be “forced to confront the issue.” M.

S., at , notwithstanding this Court's previous declaration of a fed- eral public accommodations law to be unconstitutional. Congress believed, rightly, that discrimination in places of public accommodation—“the injustice of being arbitrarily de- nied equal access to those facilities and accommodations which are otherwise open to the general public”—had “no place” in this country, the country “of the melting pot, of equal rights, of one nation and one people.” S.

ELENIS Sotomayor, J., dissenting This bargain, America would soon realize, had long ex- cluded half of society. Women, though having won the right to vote half a century earlier, were not equal in public. In- stead, a “separate-spheres ideology” had “assigned women to the home and men to the market.” E. Sepper & D. Din- ner, Sex in Public, Yale L. J. , , – () (Sep- per & Dinner). Women were excluded from restaurants, bars, civic and professional organizations, fnancial institu- tions, and sports. “Just as it did for the civil rights strug- gle, public accommodations served as kindling for feminist mobilization.” Id., at , –; cf. S. Mayeri, Reasoning From Race: Feminism, Law, and the Civil Rights Revolution – (). In response to a movement for women's libera- tion, numerous States banned discrimination in public accom- modations on the basis of “sex.” See Sepper & Dinner , nn. – (collecting statutes). Colorado was the frst State to do so. See Colo. Sess. Laws ch. , p. . In the decades that followed, the Nation opened its eyes to another injustice. People with disabilities, though inher- ently full and equal members of the public, had been ex- cluded from many areas of public life. This exclusion worked harms not only to disabled people's standards of liv- ing, but to their dignity too. So Congress, responding once again to a social movement, this time against the subordina- tion of people with disabilities, banned discrimination on that basis and secured by law disabled people's equal access to public spaces. See S. Bagenstos, Law and the Contradic- tions of the Disability Rights Movement – (); R. Col- ker, The Disability Pendulum – (). The centerpiece of this political and social action was the Americans with Disabilities Act of (ADA).

Change , () (“ `Public accommodations' is a term of art which was developed by the drafters of discrimination laws to refer to [public] places other than schools, work places, and homes”). Today, laws like Colorado's cover “any place of business engaged in any sales to the public and any place offering services . . . to the public.” Colo. Rev. Stat. § – –(); see also, e. g., Ohio Rev. Code Ann. § .(). Numerous other States extend such protections to busi- nesses offering goods or services to “the general public.” Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. § –(); see also, e. g., Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. , § A. This broader scope, though more inclusive than earlier state public accommodations laws, is in keeping with the fun- damental principle—rooted in the common law, but alive and blossoming in statutory law—that the duty to serve without unjust discrimination is owed to everyone, and it extends to any business that holds itself out as ready to serve the public. If you have ever taken advantage of a public business with- out being denied service because of who you are, then you have come to enjoy the dignity and freedom that this princi- ple protects. Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people, no less than anyone else, deserve that dignity and free- dom. The movement for LGBT rights, and the resulting Page Proof Pending Publication CREATIVE LLC v. ELENIS Sotomayor, J., dissenting expansion of state and local laws to secure gender and sexual minorities' full and equal enjoyment of publicly available goods and services, is the latest chapter of this great Ameri- can story. LGBT people have existed for all of human history. And as sure as they have existed, others have sought to deny their existence, and to exclude them from public life. Those who would subordinate LGBT people have often done so with the backing of law. For most of American history, there were laws criminalizing same-sex intimacy. Oberge- fell v. Hodges, U. S. , – (). “Gays and les- bians were [also] prohibited from most government em- ployment, barred from military service, excluded under immigration laws, targeted by police, and burdened in their rights to associate.” Id., at . “These policies worked to create and reinforce the belief that gay men and lesbians” constituted “an inferior class.” Brief for Organization of American Historians as Amicus Curiae in Obergefell v. Hodges, O. T. , No. –, p. . State-sponsored discrimination was compounded by dis- crimination in public accommodations, though the two often went hand in hand. The police raided bars looking for gays and lesbians so often that some bars put up signs saying, “ `We Do Not Serve Homosexuals.' ” Id., at (quoting G. Chauncey, Why Marriage ()). LGBT discrimination in public accommodations has continued well into the st century. See UCLA School of Law Williams Institute, C. Mallory & B. Sears, Evidence of Discrimination in Public Ac- commodations Based on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity (). A social system of discrimination created an environment in which LGBT people were unsafe. Who could forget the brutal murder of Matthew Shepard? Matthew was targeted by two men, tortured, tied to a buck fence, and left to die for who he was. See K. Drake, Gay Man Beaten, Burned and Left Tied to Fence, Casper Star-Tribune, Oct. , , Page Proof Pending Publication Cite as: U. S. () Sotomayor, J., dissenting p. A. Or the Pulse nightclub massacre, the second- deadliest mass shooting in U. S. history? See S. Stolberg, For Gays Across America, a Massacre Punctuates Fitful Gains, N. Y. Times, June , , p. A. Rates of violent victimization are still signifcantly higher for LGBT people, with transgender persons particularly vulnerable to attack. See Dept. of Justice, J. Truman & R. Morgan, Violent Victim- ization by Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity, – (). Determined not to live as “social outcasts,” Masterpiece Cakeshop, U. S., at –––, LGBT people have risen up. The social movement for LGBT rights has been long and complex. See L. Faderman, The Gay Revolution () (Faderman). But if there ever was an “earthquake,” it oc- curred in the fnal days of June in at the Stonewall Inn in Greenwich Village. Id., at . The Stonewall Inn was a gay bar with a “varied and lively clientele.” Id., at . Its “ `unruly' element” made it “an especially inviting target” for police raids. J. D'Emilio, Sexual Politics, Sexual Com- munities () (D'Emilio). “Patrons of the Stonewall tended to be young and nonwhite. Many were drag queens. . . . ” Ibid. Just before midnight on June , the New York police's Public Morals Squad showed up to the bar and started making arrests. Drag queens, for example, were arrested for offenses like being “disguised” in “un- natural attire.” N. Y. Penal Law Ann. § .() (West ). What started out as a fairly routine police raid, however, became anything but. Outside the Stonewall Inn, patrons who had been thrown out started to form a crowd. “Jeers and catcalls arose from the onlookers when a paddy wagon departed with the bartender, the Stonewall's bouncer, and three drag queens.” D'Emilio . “A few minutes later, an offcer attempted to steer the last of the patrons, a lesbian, through the bystanders to a nearby patrol car.” Id., at – . When she started to struggle, protests erupted. Page Proof Pending Publication Page Proof Pending Publication CREATIVE LLC v. ELENIS Sotomayor, J., dissenting They lasted into the night and continued into the next. News of the Stonewall protests “spread rapidly,” and “within a year gay liberation groups had sprung into existence on college campuses and in cities around the nation.” Id., at . From there, the path to LGBT rights has not been quick or easy. Nor is it over. Still, change has come: change in social attitudes, in representation, and in legal in- stitutions. Faderman –. One signifcant change has been the addition of sexual ori- entation and gender identity to public accommodations laws. State and local legislatures took note of the failure of such laws to protect LGBT people and, in response, acted to guar- antee them “all the privileges . . . of any other member of society.” Hearings on S. B. before the House Judiciary Committee, th Gen. Assem., d Reg. Sess., , – (Colo. ) (remarks of Sen. Judd). Colorado thus amended its antidiscrimination law in to prohibit the denial of pub- licly available goods or services on the basis of “sexual orien- tation.” Colo. Sess. Laws. ch. , pp. –. About half of the States now provide such protections. It is “ `unexceptional' ” that they may do so. Ante, at (quoting Masterpiece Cakeshop, U. S., at –––). “These are protections taken for granted by most people either be- cause they already have them or do not need them; these are protections against exclusion from an almost limitless number of transactions and endeavors that constitute ordi- nary civic life in a free society.” Romer v.

Cite as: U. S. () Sotomayor, J., dissenting , (). LGBT people do not seek any special treatment. All they seek is to exist in public. To inhabit public spaces on the same terms and conditions as everyone else. C Yet for as long as public accommodations laws have been around, businesses have sought exemptions from them. The civil rights and women's liberation eras are prominent exam- ples of this. Backlashes to race and sex equality gave rise to legal claims of rights to discriminate, including claims based on First Amendment freedoms of expression and asso- ciation. This Court was unwavering in its rejection of those claims, as invidious discrimination “has never been accorded affrmative constitutional protections.” Norwood v. Har- rison, U. S. , (). In particular, the refusal to deal with or to serve a class of people is not an expressive interest protected by the First Amendment. Opponents of the Civil Rights Act of objected that the law would force business owners to defy their beliefs. Cf. ante, at . They argued that the Act would deny them “any freedom to speak or to act on the basis of their religious convictions or their deep-rooted preferences for associating or not associating with certain classifcations of people.” Cong. Rec. () (remarks of Sen. Tower). Con- gress rejected those arguments. Title II of the Act, in particular, did not invade “rights of privacy [or] of free as- sociation,” Congress concluded, because the establishments covered by the law were “those regularly held open to the public in general.” H. R. Rep. No. , th Cong., st Sess., pt. , p. (); see also S. Rep. No. , at . Having failed to persuade Congress, opponents of Title II turned to the federal courts. In Heart of Atlanta Motel, one of several arguments made by the plaintiff motel owner was that Title II violated his Fifth Amendment due process Page Proof Pending Publication CREATIVE LLC v. ELENIS Sotomayor, J., dissenting rights by “tak[ing] away the personal liberty of an individual to run his business as he sees ft with respect to the selection and service of his customers.” Brief for Appellant, O. T. , No. , p. . This Court disagreed, based on “a long line of cases” holding that “prohibition of racial discrimina- tion in public accommodations” did not “interfer[e] with per- sonal liberty.” U. S., at . In Katzenbach v. McClung, U. S. (), the owner of Ollie's Barbecue (Ollie McClung) likewise argued that Title II's application to his business violated the “personal rights of persons in their personal convictions” to deny serv- ices to Black people. Brief for Appellees, O. T. , No. , p. (citing, inter alia, West Virginia Bd. of Ed. v. Bar- nette, U. S. ()). Note that McClung did not re- fuse to transact with Black people. Oh, no. He was willing to offer them take-out service at a separate counter. See Brief for NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc., as Amicus Curiae in Katzenbach v. McClung, p. , n. . Only integrated table service, you see, violated McClung's core beliefs. So he claimed a constitutional right to offer Black people a limited menu of his services. This Court re- jected that claim, citing its decision in Heart of Atlanta Motel. See U. S., at , n. . Next is Newman v. Piggie Park Enterprises, Inc., U. S. () (per curiam), in which the owner of a chain of drive-in establishments asserted that requiring him to “contribut[e]” to racial integration in any way violated the First Amendment by interfering with his religious liberty. App. to Pet. for Cert., O. T. , No. , p. a. Title II could not be applied to his business, he argued, because that would “ `controven[e] the will of God.' ” U. S., at – , n. . The Court found this argument “patently frivo- lous.” Ibid. Last but not least is Runyon v. McCrary, U. S. (), a case the majority studiously avoids. In Runyon, the Court confronted the question whether “commercially Page Proof Pending Publication Cite as: U. S. () Sotomayor, J., dissenting operated” schools had a First Amendment right to exclude Black children, notwithstanding a federal law against racial discrimination in contracting. Id., at ; see U. S. C. § . The schools in question offered “educational serv- ices” for sale to “the general public.” U. S., at . They argued that the law, as applied to them, violated their First Amendment rights of “freedom of speech, and associa- tion.” Pet. for Cert., O. T. , No. –, p. ; see also Brief for Petitioners, O. T. , No. –, p. (“Freedom to teach, to express ideas”). The Court, however, reasoned that the schools' “practice” of denying educational services to racial minorities was not shielded by the First Amend- ment, for two reasons: First, “the Constitution places no value on discrimination.” U. S., at (alterations and internal quotation marks omitted). Second, the govern- ment's regulation of conduct did not “inhibit” the schools' ability to teach its preferred “ideas or dogma.” Ibid. (inter- nal quotation marks omitted). Requiring the schools to abide by an antidiscrimination law was not the same thing as compelling the schools to express teachings contrary to their sincerely held “belief that racial segregation is desir- able.” Ibid. First Amendment rights of expression and association were also raised to challenge laws against sex discrimination. In Roberts v. United States Jaycees, the United States Jay- cees sought an exemption from a Minnesota law that forbids discrimination on the basis of sex in public accommodations. The U. S. Jaycees was a civic organization, which until then had denied admission to women. The organization alleged that applying the law to require it to include women would violate its “members' constitutional rights of free speech and association.” U. S., at . “The power of the state to change the membership of an organization is inevitably the power to change the way in which it speaks,” the Jaycees argued. Brief for Appellee, O. T. , No. –, p. Page Proof Pending Publication CREATIVE LLC v. ELENIS Sotomayor, J., dissenting (emphasis added). Thus, “the right of the Jaycees to decide its own membership” was “inseparable,” in its view, “from its ability to freely express itself.” Ibid. This Court took a different view. The Court held that the “application of the Minnesota statute to compel the Jaycees to accept women” did not infringe the organization's First Amendment “freedom of expressive association.” Roberts, U. S., at . That was so because the State's public accommodations law did “not aim at the suppression of speech” and did “not distinguish between prohibited and per- mitted activity on the basis of viewpoint.” Id., at –. If the State had applied the law “for the purpose of hamper- ing the organization's ability to express its views,” that would be a different matter. Id., at (emphasis added). “Instead,” the law's purpose was “eliminating discrimination and assuring [the State's] citizens equal access to publicly available goods and services.” Ibid. “That goal,” the Court reasoned, “was unrelated to the suppression of expres- sion” and “plainly serves compelling state interests of the highest order.” Ibid. Justice O'Connor concurred in part and concurred in the judgment. See id., at . She stressed that the U. S. Jay- cees was a predominantly commercial entity open to the pub- lic. And she took the view that there was a First Amend- ment “dichotomy” between rights of commercial and expressive association. Id., at . The State, for example, was “free to impose any rational regulation” on commercial transactions themselves. “A shopkeeper,” Justice O'Connor explained, “has no constitutional right to deal only with per- sons of one sex.” Ibid. To wit, the Court had just decided in Hishon v. King & Spalding, U. S. , (), that a law partnership had no constitutional right to discriminate on the basis of sex in violation of Title VII. The law partnership was an act of association. Its services (legal advocacy) were expressive; Page Proof Pending Publication Cite as: U. S. () Sotomayor, J., dissenting indeed, they consisted of speech. So the law frm argued that requiring it to consider a woman for the partnership violated its First Amendment rights “of free expression” and “of commercial association.” Brief for Respondent, O. T. , No. –, pp. –. This Court rejected that argu- ment. The application of Title VII did not “infringe consti- tutional rights of expression or association,” the Court held, because compliance with Title VII did not “inhibi[t]” the partnership's ability to advocate for certain “ideas and be- liefs.” U. S., at (internal quotation marks omitted); see also supra, at – (discussing Runyon, U. S., at ). The Court reiterated: “ `[I]nvidious private discrimina- tion . . . has never been accorded affrmative constitutional pro- tections.' ” U. S., at (quoting Norwood, U. S., at ). II Battling discrimination is like “battling the Hydra.” Shelby County v. Holder, U. S. , () (Gins- burg, J., dissenting). Whenever you defeat “one form of . . . discrimination,” another “spr[ings] up in its place.” Ibid. Time and again, businesses and other commercial entities have claimed constitutional rights to discriminate. And time and again, this Court has courageously stood up to those claims—until today. Today, the Court shrinks. A business claims that it would like to sell wedding websites to the general public, yet deny those same websites to gay and lesbian couples. Under state law, the business is free to include, or not to include, any lawful message it wants in its wedding websites. The only thing the business may not do is deny whatever websites it offers on the basis of sexual orientation. This Court, however, grants the business a broad exemption from state law and allows the business to post a notice that says: Wedding websites will be refused to gays and lesbians. The Court's decision, which confates denial of service and protected expression, is a grave error. Page Proof Pending Publication CREATIVE LLC v. ELENIS Sotomayor, J., dissenting A Creative LLC is a limited liability company that sells graphic and website designs for proft. Lorie Smith is the company's founder and sole member-owner. Smith believes same-sex marriages are “false,” because “ `God's true story of marriage' ” is a story of a “ `union between one man and one woman.' ” Brief for Petitioners , – (quoting App. to Pet. for Cert. a, a); Tr. of Oral Arg. , –. Same- sex marriage, according to her, “violates God's will” and “harms society and children.” App. to Pet. for Cert. a. Creative has never sold wedding websites. Smith now believes, however, that “God is calling her `to explain His true story about marriage.' ” Brief for Petitioners (quoting App. to Pet. for Cert. a). For that reason, she says, she wants her for-proft company to enter the wedding website business. There is only one thing: Smith would like her company to sell wedding websites “to the public,” App. to Pet. for Cert. a; Colo. Rev. Stat. § ––(), but not to same-sex couples. She also wants to post a notice on the company's website announcing this intent to discriminate. App. to Pet. for Cert. a–a. In Smith's view, “it would violate [her] sincerely held religious beliefs to create a wed- ding website for a same-sex wedding because, by doing so, [she] would be expressing a message celebrating and promot- ing a conception of marriage that [she] believe[s] is contrary to God's design.” Id., at a. Again, Smith's company has never sold a wedding website to any customer. Colorado, therefore, has never had to en- force its antidiscrimination laws against the company. As the majority puts it, however, Smith “worries that, if she enters the wedding website business, the State will force her to convey messages inconsistent with her belief that mar- riage should be reserved to unions between one man and one woman.” Ante, at . So Smith and her company, the petitioners here, sued the State in federal court. They sought a court decree giving them a special exemption from Page Proof Pending Publication Cite as: U. S. () Sotomayor, J., dissenting CADA's Accommodation Clause (which, remember, makes it unlawful for a business to hold itself out to the public yet deny to any individual, because of sexual orientation, the full and equal enjoyment of the business's goods or services, see supra, at –) and CADA's Communication Clause (which makes it unlawful to advertise that goods or services will be denied because of sexual orientation, see supra, at ). App. –. The breadth of petitioners' pre-enforcement challenge is astounding. According to Smith, the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment entitles her company to refuse to sell any “websites for same-sex weddings,” even though the com- pany plans to offer wedding websites to the general public. Ibid.; see also Brief for Petitioners –, and n. ; Tr. of Oral Arg. –. In other words, the company claims a categorical exemption from a public accommodations law simply because the company sells expressive services. The sweeping nature of this claim should have led this Court to reject it. B The First Amendment does not entitle petitioners to a spe- cial exemption from a state law that simply requires them to serve all members of the public on equal terms. Such a law does not directly regulate petitioners' speech at all, and peti- tioners may not escape the law by claiming an expressive interest in discrimination. The First Amendment likewise does not exempt petitioners from the law's prohibition on posting a notice that they will deny goods or services based on sexual orientation. This Court has long held that “the First Amendment does not prevent restrictions directed at commerce or conduct from imposing incidental burdens on speech.” Sorrell v. IMS Health Inc., U. S. , (). “Congress, for example, can prohibit employers from discriminating in hir- Page Proof Pending Publication CREATIVE LLC v. ELENIS Sotomayor, J., dissenting ing on the basis of race. The fact that this will require an employer to take down a sign reading `White Applicants Only' hardly means that the law should be analyzed as one regulating the employer's speech rather than conduct.” Rumsfeld v. Forum for Academic and Institutional Rights, Inc., U. S. , () (FAIR). This principle explains “why an ordinance against outdoor fres might forbid burning a fag and why antitrust laws can prohibit agreements in re- straint of trade.” Sorrell, U. S., at (citation and in- ternal quotation marks omitted). Consider United States v. O'Brien, U. S. (). In that case, the Court upheld the application of a law against the destruction of draft cards to a defendant who had burned his draft card to protest the Vietnam War. The protester's conduct was indisputably expressive. Indeed, it was political expression, which lies at the heart of the First Amendment. Whitney v. California, U. S. , () (Brandeis, J., concurring). Yet the O'Brien Court fo- cused on whether the Government's interest in regulating the conduct was to burden expression. Because it was not, the regulation was subject to lesser constitutional scrutiny. U. S., at –, –; Clark v. Community for Cre- ative Non-Violence, U. S. , , (). The O'Brien standard is satisfed if a regulation is unrelated to the suppression of expression and “ `promotes a substantial government interest that would be achieved less effectively absent the regulation.' ” FAIR, U. S., at (quoting United States v. Albertini, U. S. , ()). FAIR confronted the interaction between this principle and an equal-access law. The law at issue was the Solomon Amendment, which prohibits an institution of higher educa- tion in receipt of federal funding from denying a military recruiter “the same access to its campus and students that The majority commits a fundamental error in suggesting that a law does not regulate conduct if it ever applies to expressive activities. See ante, at , . This would come as a great surprise to the O'Brien Court. Page Proof Pending Publication Cite as: U. S. () Sotomayor, J., dissenting it provides to the nonmilitary recruiter receiving the most favorable access.” U. S., at ; see U. S. C. § (b). A group of law schools challenged the Solomon Amendment based on their sincere objection to the military's “Don't Ask, Don't Tell” policy. For those who are too young to know, “Don't Ask, Don't Tell” was a homophobic policy that barred openly LGBT people from serving in the military. LGBT people could serve only if they kept their identities secret. The idea was that their open existence was a threat to the military. The law schools in FAIR claimed that the Solomon Amend- ment infringed the schools' First Amendment freedom of speech. The schools provided recruiting assistance in the form of emails, notices on bulletin boards, and fyers. U. S., at –. As the Court acknowledged, those services “clearly involve speech.” Id., at . And the Solomon Amendment required “schools offering such services to other recruiters” to provide them equally “on behalf of the mili- tary,” even if the school deeply objected to creating such speech. Id., at . But that did not transform the equal provision of services into “compelled speech” of the kind barred by the First Amendment, because the school's speech was “only `compelled' if, and to the extent, the school pro- vides such speech for other recruiters.” Id., at . Thus, any speech compulsion was “plainly incidental to the Solo- mon Amendment's regulation of conduct.” Ibid. The same principle resolves this case. The majority tries to sweep under the rug petitioners' challenge to CADA's Communication Clause, so I will start with it. Recall that Smith wants to post a notice on her company's homepage that the company will refuse to sell any website for a same- sex couple's wedding. This Court, however, has already said that “a ban on race-based hiring may require employers to remove `White Applicants Only' signs.” Sorrell, Page Proof Pending Publication CREATIVE LLC v. ELENIS Sotomayor, J., dissenting U. S., at (quoting FAIR, U. S., at ; some internal quotation marks omitted); see Pittsburgh Press Co. v. Pitts- burgh Comm'n on Human Relations, U. S. , (). So petitioners concede that they are not entitled to an exemption from the Communication Clause unless they are also entitled to an exemption from the Accommodation Clause. Brief for Petitioners –. That concession is all but fatal to their argument, because it shows that even “pure speech” may be burdened incident to a valid regulation of conduct. CADA's Accommodation Clause and its application here are valid regulations of conduct. It is well settled that a public accommodations law like the Accommodation Clause does not “target speech or discriminate on the basis of its content.” Hurley, U. S., at . Rather, “the focal point of its prohibition” is “on the act of discriminating against individuals in the provision of publicly available goods, privileges, and services.” Ibid. (emphasis added). The State confrms this reading of CADA. The law applies only to status-based refusals to provide the full and equal enjoyment of whatever services petitioners choose to sell to the public. See Brief for Respondents –. Crucially, the law “does not dictate the content of speech at all, which is only `compelled' if, and to the extent,” the company offers “such speech” to other customers. FAIR, U. S., at . Colorado does not require the company to “speak [the State's] preferred message.” Ante, at . Nor The majority appears to fnd this discussion of the Communication Clause upsetting. See ante, at , and n. . It is easy to understand why: The Court's prior First Amendment cases clearly explain that a ban on discrimination may require a business to take down a sign that ex- presses the business owner's intent to discriminate. See, e. g., FAIR, U. S., at . This principle is deeply inconsistent with the majority's posi- tion. Thus, a “straight couples only” notice, like the one the Court today allows, see App. to Pet. for Cert. a–a, is itself a devastating indict- ment of the majority's logic. Page Proof Pending Publication Page Proof Pending Publication Cite as: U. S. () Sotomayor, J., dissenting does it prohibit the company from speaking the company's preferred message. The company could, for example, offer only wedding websites with biblical quotations describing marriage as between one man and one woman. Brief for Respondents . (Just as it could offer only t-shirts with such quotations.) The company could also refuse to include the words “Love is Love” if it would not provide those words to any customer. All the company has to do is offer its serv- ices without regard to customers' protected characteristics. Id., at –. Any effect on the company's speech is there- fore “incidental” to the State's content-neutral regulation of conduct. FAIR, U. S., at ; see Hurley, U. S., at –. Once these features of the law are understood, it becomes clear that petitioners' freedom of speech is not abridged in any meaningful sense, factual or legal. Petitioners remain free to advocate the idea that same-sex marriage betrays God's laws. FAIR, U. S., at ; Hishon, U. S., at ; Runyon, U. S., at . Even if Smith believes God is calling her to do so through her for-proft company, the com- pany need not hold out its goods or services to the public at large. Many flmmakers, visual artists, and writers never do. (That is why the law does not require Steven Spielberg or Banksy to make flms or art for anyone who asks. But cf. ante, at , –.) Finally, and most importantly, even if the company offers its goods or services to the public, it remains free under state law to decide what messages to include or not to include. To repeat (because it escapes the majority): The company can put whatever “harmful” or “low- value” speech it wants on its websites. It can “tell people what they do not want to hear.” Ante, at (internal quo- tation marks and brackets omitted). All the company may not do is offer wedding websites to the public yet refuse those same websites to gay and lesbian couples. See Ru- nyon, U. S., at (distinguishing between schools' abil- ity to express their bigoted view “that racial segregation is CREATIVE LLC v. ELENIS Sotomayor, J., dissenting desirable” and the schools' proscribable “practice of exclud- ing racial minorities”). Another example might help to illustrate the point. A professional photographer is generally free to choose her subjects. She can make a living taking photos of fowers or celebrities. The State does not regulate that choice. If the photographer opens a portrait photography business to the public, however, the business may not deny to any person, because of race, sex, national origin, or other protected char- acteristic, the full and equal enjoyment of whatever services the business chooses to offer. That is so even though por- trait photography services are customized and expressive. If the business offers school photos, it may not deny those services to multiracial children because the owner does not want to create any speech indicating that interracial couples are acceptable. If the business offers corporate headshots, it may not deny those services to women because the owner believes a woman's place is in the home. And if the business offers passport photos, it may not deny those services to Mexican Americans because the owner opposes immigration from Mexico. The same is true for sexual-orientation discrimination. If a photographer opens a photo booth outside of city hall and offers to sell newlywed photos captioned with the words “Just Married,” she may not refuse to sell that service to a newlywed gay or lesbian couple, even if she believes the cou- ple is not, in fact, just married because in her view their marriage is “false.” Tr. of Oral Arg. , –. Because any burden on petitioners' speech is incidental to CADA's neutral regulation of commercial conduct, the regu- lation is subject to the standard set forth in O'Brien. That standard is easily satisfed here because the law's application “promotes a substantial government interest that would be achieved less effectively absent the regulation.” FAIR, Page Proof Pending Publication Cite as: U. S. () Sotomayor, J., dissenting U. S., at (internal quotation marks omitted). Indeed, this Court has already held that the State's goal of “eliminating discrimination and assuring its citizens equal access to pub- licly available goods and services” is “unrelated to the sup- pression of expression” and “plainly serves compelling state interests of the highest order.” Roberts, U. S., at . The Court has also held that by prohibiting only “acts of invidious discrimination in the distribution of publicly avail- able goods, services, and other advantages,” the law “re- sponds precisely to the substantive problem which legiti- mately concerns the State and abridges no more speech . . . than is necessary to accomplish that purpose.” Id., at – (emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted); see supra, at –. C The Court reaches the wrong answer in this case because it asks the wrong questions. The question is not whether the company's products include “elements of speech.” FAIR, U. S., at . (They do.) The question is not even whether CADA would require the company to create and sell speech, notwithstanding the owner's sincere objection to doing so, if the company chooses to offer “such speech” to the public. Id., at . (It would.) These questions do not resolve the First Amendment inquiry any more than they did in FAIR. Instead, the proper focus is on the character of state action and its relationship to expression. Because Colorado seeks to apply CADA only to the refusal to provide same-sex couples the full and equal enjoyment of the com- pany's publicly available services, so that the company's speech “is only `compelled' if, and to the extent,” the com- pany chooses to offer “such speech” to the public, any burden on speech is “plainly incidental” to a content-neutral regula- tion of conduct. Ibid. The majority attempts to distinguish this clear holding of FAIR by suggesting that the compelled speech in FAIR was “incidental” because it was “logistical” (e. g., “The U. S. Page Proof Pending Publication Page Proof Pending Publication CREATIVE LLC v. ELENIS Sotomayor, J., dissenting Army recruiter will meet interested students in Room at a.m.”). Ante, at (internal quotation marks omitted). This attempt fails twice over. First, the law schools in FAIR alleged that the Solomon Amendment required them to create and disseminate speech propagating the military's message, which they deeply objected to, and to include mili- tary speakers in on- and off-campus forums (if the schools provided equally favorable services to other recruiters). U. S., at –; App. and Brief for Respondents – in Rumsfeld v. Forum for Academic and Institutional Rights, Inc., O. T. , No. –. The majority simply skips over the Court's key reasoning for why any speech compulsion was nevertheless “incidental” to the Amend- ment's regulation of conduct: It would occur only “if, and to the extent,” the regulated entity provided “such speech” to others. FAIR, U. S., at . Likewise in O'Brien, the reason the burden on O'Brien's expression was incidental was not because his message was factual or uncontroversial. But cf. ante, at . O'Brien burned his draft card to send a political message, and the burden on his expression was substantial. Still, the burden was “incidental” because it was ancillary to a regulation that did not aim at expression. U. S., at . Second, the majority completely ignores the categorical nature of the exemption claimed by petitioners. Petitioners maintain, as they have throughout this litigation, that they will refuse to create any wedding website for a same-sex couple. Even an announcement of the time and place of a wedding (similar to the majority's example from FAIR) abridges petitioners' freedom of speech, they claim, because “the announcement of the wedding itself is a concept that [Smith] believes to be false.” Tr. of Oral Arg. . Indeed, petitioners here concede that if a same-sex couple came across an opposite-sex wedding website created by the com- pany and requested an identical website, with only the names Cite as: U. S. () Sotomayor, J., dissenting and date of the wedding changed, petitioners would refuse. Id., at –. That is status-based discrimination, plain and simple. Oblivious to this fact, the majority insists that petitioners discriminate based on message, not status. The company, says the majority, will not sell same-sex wedding websites to anyone. Ante, at . It will sell only opposite-sex wed- ding websites; that is its service. Petitioners, however, “cannot defne their service as `opposite-sex wedding [web- sites]' any more than a hotel can recast its services as `whites-only lodgings.' ” Telescope Media Group v. Lucero, F. d , (CA ) (Kelly, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). To allow a business open to the public to defne the expressive quality of its goods or services to exclude a protected group would nullify public accommo- dations laws. It would mean that a large retail store could sell “passport photos for white people.” The majority protests that Smith will gladly sell her goods and services to anyone, including same-sex couples. Ante, at , . She just will not sell websites for same-sex wed- dings. Apparently, a gay or lesbian couple might buy a wed- ding website for their straight friends. This logic would be Because petitioners have never sold a wedding website to anyone, the record contains only a mockup website. The mockup confrms what you would expect: The website provides details of the event, a form to RSVP, a gift registry, etc. See App. –. The customization of these elements pursuant to a content-neutral regulation of conduct does not unconstitu- tionally intrude upon any protected expression of the website designer. Yet Smith claims a First Amendment right to refuse to provide any wed- ding website for a same-sex couple. Her claim therefore rests on the idea that her act of service is itself a form of protected expression. In grant- ing Smith's claim, the majority collapses the distinction between status- based and message-based refusals of service. The history shows just how profoundly wrong that is. See Runyon v. McCrary, U. S. , (); Hishon v. King & Spalding, U. S. , (); Roberts v. United States Jaycees, U. S. , – (). Page Proof Pending Publication CREATIVE LLC v. ELENIS Sotomayor, J., dissenting amusing if it were not so embarrassing. I suppose the Heart of Atlanta Motel could have argued that Black people may still rent rooms for their white friends. Smith answers that she will sell other websites for gay or lesbian clients. But then she, like Ollie McClung, who would serve Black people take-out but not table service, discriminates against LGBT people by offering them a limited menu. This is plain to see, for all who do not look the other way. The majority, however, analogizes this case to Hurley and Boy Scouts of America v. Dale, U. S. (). The law schools in FAIR likewise relied on Hurley and Dale to argue that the Solomon Amendment violated their free- speech rights. FAIR confrmed, however, that a neutral regulation of conduct imposes an incidental burden on speech when the regulation grants a right of equal access that re- quires the regulated party to provide speech only if, and to the extent, it provides such speech for others. Supra, at –, –. Hurley and Dale, by contrast, involved “peculiar” applica- tions of public accommodations laws, not to “the act of dis- criminating . . . in the provision of publicly available goods” by “clearly commercial entities,” but rather to private, non- proft expressive associations in ways that directly burdened speech. Hurley, U. S., at (private parade); Dale, U. S., at (Boy Scouts). The Court in Hurley and Dale stressed that the speech burdens in those cases were not The majority tacitly acknowledges the absurdity. At the start of its opinion, it explains that Smith “decided to expand her offerings to include services for couples seeking websites for their weddings.” Ante, at (emphasis added). What is “ `embarrassing' ” about this reasoning is not, as the Court claims, the “distinction between status and message.” Ante, at , n. . It is petitioners' contrivance, embraced by the Court, that a prohibition on status-based discrimination can be avoided by asserting that a group can always buy services on behalf of others, or else that the group can access a “separate but equal” subset of the services made available to everyone else. Page Proof Pending Publication Cite as: U. S. () Sotomayor, J., dissenting incidental to prohibitions on status-based discrimination be- cause the associations did not assert that “mere acceptance of a member from a particular group would impair [the asso- ciation's] message.” Dale, U. S., at ; see also ibid. (reasoning that Dale was excluded for being a gay rights activist, not for being gay); ibid. (explaining that in Hurley, “the parade organizers did not wish to exclude the GLIB [Irish-American gay, lesbian, and bisexual group] mem- bers because of their sexual orientations, but because they wanted to march behind a GLIB banner”); Hurley, U. S., at –. Here, the opposite is true. Creative LLC is a “clearly commercial entit[y].” Dale, U. S., at . The company comes under the regulation of CADA only if it sells services to the public, and only if it denies the equal enjoyment of such services because of sexual orientation. The State con- frms that the company is free to include or not to include any message in whatever services it chooses to offer. Supra, at –. And the company confrms that it plans to engage in status-based discrimination. Supra, at –, –. Therefore, any burden on the company's expression is inci- dental to the State's content-neutral regulation of commer- cial conduct. Frustrated by this inescapable logic, the majority dials up the rhetoric, asserting that “Colorado seeks to compel [the company's] speech in order to excise certain ideas or view- points from the public dialogue.” The State's “very purpose in seeking to apply its law,” in the majority's view, is “the coercive elimination of dissenting ideas about marriage.” Ante, at (internal quotation marks and brackets omit- ted). That is an astonishing view of the law. It is con- trary to the fact that a law requiring public-facing businesses The majority's repeated invocation of this Orwellian thought policing is revealing of just how much it misunderstands this case.

So it is dispiriting to read the majority suggest that this case resembles West Virginia Bd. of Ed. v. Barnette, U. S. (). A content-neutral equal-access policy is “a far cry” from a mandate to “endorse” a pledge chosen by the Government. FAIR, U. S., at . This Court has said “it trivializes the freedom protected in Barnette” to equate the two. Ibid. Requiring Smith's company to abide by a law against invidious discrimination in commercial sales to the public does not conscript her into espousing the govern- ment's message. It does not “invad[e]” her “sphere of intel- lect” or violate her constitutional “right to differ.” Ante, at , (internal quotation marks omitted). All it does is require her to stick to her bargain: “The owner who hangs a shingle and offers her services to the public cannot retreat from the promise of open service; to do so is to offer the public marked money. It is to convey the promise of a free and open society and then take the prize away from the de- spised few.” J. Singer, We Don't Serve Your Kind Here: Public Accommodations and the Mark of Sodom, B. U. L. Rev. , (). III Today is a sad day in American constitutional law and in the lives of LGBT people. The Supreme Court of the United States declares that a particular kind of business, though open to the public, has a constitutional right to refuse Page Proof Pending Publication Page Proof Pending Publication Cite as: U. S. () Sotomayor, J., dissenting to serve members of a protected class. The Court does so for the frst time in its history. By issuing this new license to discriminate in a case brought by a company that seeks to deny same-sex couples the full and equal enjoyment of its services, the immediate, symbolic effect of the decision is to mark gays and lesbians for second-class status. In this way, the decision itself inficts a kind of stigmatic harm, on top of any harm caused by denials of service. The opinion of the Court is, quite literally, a notice that reads: “Some services may be denied to same-sex couples.” “The truth is,” these “affronts and denials” “are intensely human and personal.” S. Rep. No. , at (internal quo- tation marks omitted). Sometimes they may “harm the physical body, but always they strike at the root of the human spirit, at the very core of human dignity.” Ibid. To see how, imagine a same-sex couple browses the public mar- ket with their child. The market could be online or in a shopping mall. Some stores sell products that are custo- mized and expressive. The family sees a notice announcing that services will be refused for same-sex weddings. What message does that send? It sends the message that we live in a society with social castes. It says to the child of the same-sex couple that their parents' relationship is not equal to others'. And it reminds LGBT people of a painful feeling that they know all too well: There are some public places where they can be themselves, and some where they cannot. K. Yoshino, Covering – (). Ask any LGBT person, and you will learn just how often they are forced to navigate life in this way. They must ask themselves: If I reveal my identity to this co-worker, or to this shopkeeper, will they treat me the same way? If I hold the hand of my partner in this setting, will someone stare at me, harass me, or even hurt me? It is an awful way to live. Freedom from this way of life is the very object of a law that declares: All mem- bers of the public are entitled to inhabit public spaces on equal terms. CREATIVE LLC v. ELENIS Sotomayor, J., dissenting This case cannot be understood outside of the context in which it arises. In that context, the outcome is even more distressing. The LGBT rights movement has made historic strides, and I am proud of the role this Court recently played in that history. Today, however, we are taking steps back- ward. A slew of anti-LGBT laws have been passed in some parts of the country, raising the specter of a “bare . . . de- sire to harm a politically unpopular group.” Romer, U. S., at (internal quotation marks omitted). This is es- pecially unnerving when “for centuries there have been pow- erful voices to condemn” this small minority. Lawrence v. Texas, U. S. , (). In this pivotal moment, the Court had an opportunity to reaffrm its commitment to equality on behalf of all members of society, including LGBT people. It does not do so. Although the consequences of today's decision might be most pressing for the LGBT community, the decision's logic cannot be limited to discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. The decision threatens to balkanize the market and to allow the exclusion of other groups from many services. A website designer could equally refuse to create a wedding website for an interracial couple, for example. How quickly we forget that opposition to interracial marriage was often because “ `Almighty God . . . did not intend for the races to mix.' ” Loving v. Vir- ginia, U. S. , (). Yet the reason for discrimi- nation need not even be religious, as this case arises under the Free Speech Clause. A stationer could refuse to sell a birth announcement for a disabled couple because she op- poses their having a child. A large retail store could re- These laws variously censor discussion of sexual orientation and gen- der identity in schools, see, e. g., Ky. Acts pp. –, and ban drag shows in public, see Tenn. Pub. Acts ch. . Yet we are told that the real threat to free speech is that a commercial business open to the public might have to serve all members of the public.

Wedding websites, birth announcements, family portraits, epitaphs. These are not just words and images. They are the most profound moments in a human's life. They are the moments that give that life personal and cultural meaning. You already heard the story of Bob and Jack, the elderly gay couple forced to fnd a funeral home more than an hour away. Supra, at –, and n. . Now hear the story of Cynthia and Sherry, a lesbian couple of years until Cynthia died from cancer at age . When Cynthia was diagnosed, she drew up a will, which authorized Sherry to make burial ar- rangements. Cynthia had asked Sherry to include an in- scription on her headstone, listing the relationships that were important to her, for example, “daughter, granddaugh- ter, sister, and aunt.” After Cynthia died, the cemetery was willing to include those words, but not the words that de- scribed Cynthia's relationship to Sherry: “ `beloved life part- ner.' ” N. Knauer, Gay and Lesbian Elders (). There are many such stories, too many to tell here. And after today, too many to come. I fear that the symbolic damage of the Court's opinion is done. But that does not mean that we are powerless in the face of the decision. The meaning of our Constitution is found not in any law volume, but in the spirit of the people who live under it. Every business owner in America has a choice whether to live out the values in the Constitution. The potential implications of the Court's logic are deeply troubling. Would Runyon v. McCrary have come out differently if the schools had argued that accepting Black children would have required them to create original speech, like lessons, report cards, or diplomas, that they deeply objected to? What if the law frm in Hishon v. King & Spalding had argued that promoting a woman to the partnership would have required it to alter its speech, like letterhead or court flings, in ways that it would rather not? Once you look closely, “compelled speech” (in the majority's facile understanding of that concept) is everywhere. Page Proof Pending Publication CREATIVE LLC v. ELENIS Sotomayor, J., dissenting Make no mistake: Invidious discrimination is not one of them. “[D]iscrimination in any form and in any degree has no justi- fable part whatever in our democratic way of life.” Kore- matsu v. United States, U. S. , () (Murphy, J., dissenting). “It is unattractive in any setting but it is ut- terly revolting among a free people who have embraced the principles set forth in the Constitution of the United States.” Ibid. The unattractive lesson of the majority opinion is this: What's mine is mine, and what's yours is yours. The lesson of the history of public accommodations laws is altogether different. It is that in a free and democratic society, there can be no social castes. And for that to be true, it must be true in the public market. For the “promise of freedom” is an empty one if the Government is “powerless to assure that a dollar in the hands of [one person] will purchase the same thing as a dollar in the hands of a[nother].” Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co., U. S. , (). Because the Court today retreats from that promise, I dissent.
