We'll hear argument next in Case -, Great Lakes Insurance versus Raiders Retreat Realty. Mr. Wall. ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY B. WALL ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERYour -- your argument, I take it, is that there is an established federal maritime rule not simply on choice-of-law provisions but, I don't know, the Uberrimae Fidei doctrine, in other words, that even if your boat runs aground, you know, if you didn't have the fire extinguisher, you know, updated, you -- you lose. What if there weren't an established maritime policy on that specific doctrine?Well, I wonder if it --I was just going to say -- sorry to interrupt -- but, I mean, certainly, the argument can be made -- and I -- I think it's the argument of your friend on the other side -- that Wilburn Boat is expressly designed to do what you indicated that it doesn't matter, which is, if you have a very particular question like how the insurance policy should be interpreted, and there's no federal rule. There are general federal rules about choice-of-law, you know, but not the particular question there.
