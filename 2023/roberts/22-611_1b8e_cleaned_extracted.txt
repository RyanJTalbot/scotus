We'll hear argument next in Case -, Lindke versus Freed. Mr. Kedem. ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALLON KEDEM ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERWell, I mean, these -- on these pages, people -- people have both a job in the government and they have all sorts of other things, whether it's cats or children or whatever it is, and the problem it seems to me is we kind of have to disaggregate that, right, and say, well, you know, you have to have a governmental page and you have to have a private page and you can't mention the government on your private page or else it's going to become a government page. And as I understand it, you basically say, if you've got percent government, then we, the government, can basically say the whole thing, even if the rest of it is all about your children and -- and -- and the dogs, that's ours. And if we don't like little dogs, we can say you can't put pictures of little dogs on there.
