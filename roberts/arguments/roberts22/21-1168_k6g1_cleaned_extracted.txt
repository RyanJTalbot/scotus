We will hear argument first this morning in Case -, Mallory versus Norfolk Southern Railway. Mr. Keller. ORAL ARGUMENT OF ASHLEY C. KELLER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERWell, history -- history and tradition move on, and as Justice Scalia said in the Daimler case, you shouldn't put heavy reliance on precedents from the Pennoyer era. Doesn't International Shoe sort of relegate that body of cases to the dust bin of history?Well, International Shoe, I mean, the fact that they didn't have a footnote saying, oh, all these other cases inconsistent with our approach have been overruled doesn't mean that they're any less -- no longer good law.Thank you,
