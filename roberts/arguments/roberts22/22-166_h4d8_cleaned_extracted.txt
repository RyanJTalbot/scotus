We'll hear argument this morning in Case -, Tyler versus Hennepin County, Minnesota. Ms. Martin. ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTINA M. MARTIN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERWell, it's a deeply rooted right that's traditionally defined by state law. You know, in some places, your property line goes up to the high water mark. In other states, it goes -- goes to the low water mark. And when you take property there, it's -- it's wherever the state law has defined it. What -- what if you -- Minnesota has a law sort of going forward and they say from now on, in Minnesota, if you get property, you have to know that we, the state, are going to take it if you don't pay taxes for three years? And people go in with that expectation. The market value is discounted because of that. If -- eventuality occurs, there's no taxes for three years, they take the property entirely, is that a taking or not?Well, then, if it's not defined by state law, what's it defined by?Well, there were states, I guess Virginia and Kentucky, that had a similar procedure as -- as Minnesota here today, you know, way back when, I guess before the founding or at the founding. Now, if you own property in Virginia and there was that basic -- I don't know if it's common law or statute in that -- that case -- would you have a takings claim if somebody acted -- if the state took your property consistent with a provision in law that had been in effect from the beginning?Well, back then, Virginia was hardly localized. I mean, it was a -- it was a large and important state, and I think the western bounds of it hadn't yet been defined, and different ---- different states had different rules, and -- and they chose to have a rule that had an exception to what today we might think of as common definition of property.What do you --I'm sorry, go ahead.Thank you, counsel.
