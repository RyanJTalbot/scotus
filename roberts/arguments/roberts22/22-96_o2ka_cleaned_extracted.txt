We'll hear argument today in Case -, Financial Oversight and Management Board for Puerto Rico versus Centro de Periodismo Investigativo. Counsel. ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK D. HARRIS ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERYou analogize in your argument to the sovereign immunity of states, the sovereign immunity of -- of tribes, and I wonder if Puerto Rico's situation, though, is significantly different both with respect to states and with respect to tribes. They had sovereignty at the time of the convention, and that carried forward just as the states' carried forward, just as the tribes' carried forward. Puerto Rico, obviously, at some point at -- at points in the past had the sovereignty of Spain, but that did not carry over in any sense. It -- so the question would be not to the -- the extent to which the Constitution recognized the existing sovereignty. The question would be, did they -- the Constitution in any way confer sovereignty, create sovereignty, with respect to Puerto Rico? And, as far as the Plan of the Convention goes, the Plan of the Convention was to cover the territories with plenary authority on Congress's part, not with any notion of sovereignty.
