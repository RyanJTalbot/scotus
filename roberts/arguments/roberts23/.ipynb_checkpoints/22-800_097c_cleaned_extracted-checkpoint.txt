We will -- we'll hear argument this morning in Case -, Moore versus United States. Counsel. ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW M. GROSSMAN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERSWell, there certainly is realization here by the corporation, if not the taxpayers, right? It isn't a case like appreciation of property where nothing has happened. You know, you buy a property, you're holding it for years, you haven't sold it, nothing has happened. Here, something has happened, and income has gone to the corporation, isn't that right?Thank you, counsel.
