I mean, I understand your point that the traveler's checks, the money orders, small, small amounts, the official checks, the agent checks, and the teller checks not limited, but how many of each are there? Where -- where is -- where is all the money? Is it the money orders and traveler's checks or the big bank check -- checks?Yeah, but the question there I guess is how many of them there We'll hear argument first this morning -- well, this morning, in Original Case , New York versus New Jersey. Ms. Vale. ORAL ARGUMENT OF JUDITH N. VALE ON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFFYou said in your opening -- you said that the parties omitted a termination clause. But there's no evidence that they made a conscious decision to do that, is there? We're just dealing with a situation where, as far as we know, they didn't address the issue at all?Well, but that's a whole different level of -- of cooperation. The whole port, that's a lot of stuff going on. This is a very important but relatively small enterprise dealing with a particular problem.

NORRIS ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERWould you have any objection if you do not ask candidates for admission to -- to check a box, what their race is, but you are allowed to take into consideration what an applicant would say in an -- in an essay about having to confront discrimination growing up and how he or she did that. You are allowed to take in consideration what a faculty recommender said. You know, one of the things that, you know, this applicant would bring is how to deal with racial discrimination in an area or in a school where he's part of a very small minority. Is there any -- do you have any objection to that sort of introduction of -- of race on behalf of a particular applicant?Thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas?Justice Alito?Anything further, Justice Kagan? Justice Kavanaugh?Justice Barrett?Thank you, counsel. Mr. Waxman. ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTJustice -- Justice Alito would like to ask a question.Thank you, counsel.We'll get to you in a moment. There's been a lot of talk about African American applicants to Harvard in sort of a general indistinguishable way when, in fact, they cover a very broad swath of -- of applicants.What do you do with respect to an African American applicant? I mean, you're concerned about diversity of viewpoint. Let's say his viewpoints tend to be very close to, you know, the white applicants, he grew up in Grosse Point, you know, had a great upbringing, comfortable, his parents went to Harvard, he's a legacy, and yet, under your system, when he checks African American, he gets a -- a tip. He gets a benefit from that. Isn't that ---- isn't that very stereotypical on -- under the Harvard program?I can't see it because it's far away. But, I mean -- (Laughter.)-- it is not zero.Well, so there's only a little racial discrimination in the case.Well, isn't that ---- isn't that what is -- Mr. Waxman, isn't that what the case is about, the discrimination against Asian Americans?

GEYSER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERWell --I -- I was just going to say, however many times it comes up in general, this was a specific case in which the government makes a strong argument that the facts did change and changed dramatically. The United States jumped in when they -- when the extent of the burden in terms of the documents they would have to review became clear and when also the -- at least some questionable conduct of your client with respect to discovery came to light.Sure.Thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas, any? Justice Alito?Justice --Justice Kagan? Justice Gorsuch?Justice Barrett? Justice Jackson?Thank you, counsel. Mr. Liu. ORAL ARGUMENT OF FREDERICK LIU ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT UNITED STATESMr. Liu, it -- it -- your case would be easier for you, maybe for us, if your client had a more robust view of Article II. I was surprised it's cited only once in your brief, you know, on page . We're talking about the government's ability to control a suit with billions of dollars of money defrauded against federal law according to the allegations, and yet you're -- you're not arguing much about the President's authority to enforce that -- that statute at all.Well, that depends upon your prevailing in -- in this case. I mean, if you don't, then your authority to control the action would be significantly circumscribed.Justice Thomas, anything further? Justice Alito?Justice Sotomayor?Justice Kagan?Justice Gorsuch?Justice Barrett? Justice Jackson?Thank you, counsel. Mr. Mosier. ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK W. MOSIER ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT EXECUTIVE HEALTH RESOURCES, INC.Counsel, is it consistent with the Congress's view of these sorts of actions, going back to , to continue to leave the entire proceeding in the hands of the government, which it would be under your theory? In other words, the government didn't have a statutory right to intervene until -something. And yet, now you would join the government and say basically that they can bring the -- bring the suit to a halt at any time and, given the looseness of the standard that's being We'll hear argument first this morning in Case -, Merrill versus Milligan, and the consolidated case.

McCOY ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERSCounsel, you and your friend on the other side both rely on this Court's opinion in -- in Beggerly, and I -- I'm not sure why it matters to you whether it's a jurisdictional ruling or simply a ruling about equitable estoppel. Either way -- I mean, maybe you're right on jurisdiction, maybe you're not right on jurisdiction, but either way you lose because the one thing Beggerly was quite clear about was that there was no equitable estoppel. It went through and gave the reasons for that under the Quiet Title Act. Which your client is looking for is equitable estoppel because you didn't meet the -- satisfy the timeline. But whether you're right in Beggerly about jurisdiction or not, you still lose, right?Yeah, but they're going to -- they're -- they're not going to have any trouble carrying that burden because Beggerly says quite clearly that whether -- whether jurisdictional or not, you -- you don't get -- years is years. You don't get beyond that.Well, if you're looking at the ways it's used, does it make a difference -- I mean, certainly, we've articulate -- correctly set forth the test that we've articulated, and it makes -- the application is pretty direct going forward. The people across the street are on clear notice that they've really got to spell it out if they want one of these time limits to be We will hear argument first this morning in Case -, Mallory versus Norfolk Southern Railway. Mr. Keller. ORAL ARGUMENT OF ASHLEY C. KELLER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERWell, history -- history and tradition move on, and as Justice Scalia said in the Daimler case, you shouldn't put heavy reliance on precedents from the Pennoyer era. Doesn't International Shoe sort of relegate that body of cases to the dust bin of history?Well, International Shoe, I mean, the fact that they didn't have a footnote saying, oh, all these other cases inconsistent with our approach have been overruled doesn't mean that they're any less -- no longer good law.Thank you, We'll hear argument next in Case -, Ciminelli versus United States.

I mean, the Secretary doesn't even know, the Commissioner, that you have accounts or that you're out there, and yet the -- the listing only one account would seem to me to be, you know, a -- mistaken under your view, but at least the Secretary is aware that you're out there and -- and have foreign accounts. Don't you think it's a -- a problem that not filing at all and filing incomplete have the same fine?You can finish.Thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas?Justice Alito? Justice Sotomayor?Justice Kagan?

In other words, I understand the argument that this doesn't bar jurisdiction across the waterfront, but it does seem to bar any further inquiry into the validity of the sale or lease. No?So ---- so what would you have left apart from the issues of waiver?Thank you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC SCHNAPPER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERSWell, but, I mean, the -- the -- the difference is that the Google, You -- YouTube, they're still not responsible for the content of the videos or -- or text that is transmitted. Your focus is on the actual selection and recommendations. They're responsible that a particular item is there but not for what the item -- item says. And I -- I don't -- I -- I think part -- it may be significant if the algorithm is the same across -- as Justice Thomas was suggesting, across the different subject matters, because then they don't have a focused algorithm with respect to terrorist activities or -- or pilaf or something, and then I think it might be harder for you to say that there's selection involved for which they could be held responsible.Thank you, counsel. Just one short question. Your -- your friend on the other side presented an analogy that she thought would be helpful, which -- a book seller that has a table with sports books on it, and somebody comes in and says, I'm looking for the book about, you know, Roger Maris, and the bookseller says, well, it's over there on the table with the other sports books. Isn't that analogous to what's happening here? You type in ISIS --Well, we'll figure out where we get -- it gets us in a minute. But I just want to know if you think that's a good -- a good analogy.That's what we call -- that's what we call questions.What lies ahead is, "I give up, Your Honor."Yeah.No, what lies ahead is the idea that you could look at that and say it's not pitching something in particular to the person who's made the request. It is recognizing that it's a request about a particular subject matter and it's there on the table, and they might want to look at that or We will hear argument first this morning in Case -, In re Grand Jury.

Is that document privileged in that situation?Well, I know, but that -- yes, but you can affect how that determination is going to be made, I guess, by throwing in every reason you can. You know, should I -- should I put -- you know, a client says, should I put in this amount or that amount? And you go through an analysis, well, maybe this, maybe that, and then, you know, just -- even if you've only got a percent chance of -- of prevailing, it could still be bona fide.

Would that be covered by the statute or not?Right. The facts he gave, the friend who he knew was committing all these crimes and all that, and he gave him a gun.

Mr. Barney. ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES R. BARNEY ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERCounsel, I think it was wise of you to mention (b)() in your opening because I think that's the biggest hurdle you've got to get over, and it's a situation where Congress specifically addressed tolling in a case of disability preventing a timely filing. Now you say, well, that was only for disability pensions. It had nothing to do and your case is, of course, service-connected. But, you know, at least they were addressing that particular issue, and it seems odd to me to have express -- I don't know whether it's tolling, right, in -- in -- in the one provision, but another one which is the same We'll hear argument next in Case -, Reed versus Goertz.

(Laughter.)If your -- if your client's website was the same as it is, but the only indication of any limitation was a tag line at the end saying these services are for heterosexual couples only, could that constitutionally be applied under the Colorado statute?No, no. Well, no -- as in your case, no websites. No websites are available for -- except for heterosexual couples.Yeah, same thing.Okay. What if it said, I -- I won't provide websites for anything other than heterosexual marriages because of religious reasons? Could that be covered, or is it simply the invocation of religious basis for the objection that protects it from coverage under the statute?I -- I guess I don't understand that answer.

And it seems to me that if you're supposed to protect those rights and you're the person who's responsible for conferring -- living up to those rights, that -- that seems to me that it ought to be sufficiently direct under -- under Blessing or Gonzaga or any of the others.Thank you, counsel.I just have one last question. On the alternative remedy for grievances, does it matter that what you rely on the most is an administrative regulation rather than the statutory language? Because, obviously, the statutory language, you can analyze that as what the state had -- was on notice about or -- or not, but I don't know that that's true with respect to subsequent regulations.Well, I -- I -- I would contest that proposition since the We will hear argument next in Case -, Cruz versus Arizona. Mr. Katyal. ORAL ARGUMENT OF NEAL K. KATYAL ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERCounsel, you phrased this and present it, for understandable reasons, as hostility to a particular federal rule.

I mean, the state doesn't have to provide collateral review of this particular claim, and they're -- they've decided they're not going to. And you -- and that doesn't exhibit hostility. It's just shaping the availability of collateral review, just as AEDPA does in the federal system.Thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas, anything further? Justice Alito?Justice Kagan? Okay. Thank you, counsel. Mr. Kanefield. ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH A. KANEFIELD ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTThank you, counsel.

The message is different.Well, what I guess I'm trying to suggest is that there may be nothing left to -- to the original author for derivative works.

MARTIN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERWell, it's a deeply rooted right that's traditionally defined by state law. You know, in some places, your property line goes up to the high water mark. In other states, it goes -- goes to the low water mark. And when you take property there, it's -- it's wherever the state law has defined it. What -- what if you -- Minnesota has a law sort of going forward and they say from now on, in Minnesota, if you get property, you have to know that we, the state, are going to take it if you don't pay taxes for three years? And people go in with that expectation. The market value is discounted because of that. If -- eventuality occurs, there's no taxes for three years, they take the property entirely, is that a taking or not?Well, then, if it's not defined by state law, what's it defined by?Well, there were states, I guess Virginia and Kentucky, that had a similar procedure as -- as Minnesota here today, you know, way back when, I guess before the founding or at the founding. Now, if you own property in Virginia and there was that basic -- I don't know if it's common law or statute in that -- that case -- would you have a takings claim if somebody acted -- if the state took your property consistent with a provision in law that had been in effect from the beginning?Well, back then, Virginia was hardly localized. I mean, it was a -- it was a large and important state, and I think the western bounds of it hadn't yet been defined, and different ---- different states had different rules, and -- and they chose to have a rule that had an exception to what today we might think of as common definition of property.What do you --I'm sorry, go ahead.Thank you, counsel. We'll hear argument first this morning in Case -, Groff versus the Postmaster General, Louis DeJoy. Mr. Streett. ORAL ARGUMENT OF AARON STREETT ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERIt's -- it seems to me we might be getting a little ahead of ourselves in talking about the ADA standard or -- or some others. The first question presented just says whether or not the test applied in -- in Hardison is an appropriate test, their interpretation of undue burden. We don't have to address the second issue, do we?Well, there might be -- there are differences between ADA cases, USERRA cases, Pregnancy Work Act cases. They apply to a fairly discrete category of individuals. Title VII, obviously, has a broader -- broader scope, and I'm wondering if that's the sort of issue that we need to address here when we -- it seems to me there's enough on our plate perhaps with respect to the undue burden standard.Justice Kagan. Seniority.Thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas? Justice Alito?Justice Sotomayor? Justice Kagan?Justice Gorsuch? Justice Kavanaugh?Justice Barrett?Justice Jackson?Thank you, counsel. General Prelogar. ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. ELIZABETH B. PRELOGAR ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT GENERAL PRELOGAR: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: For almost years, courts have applied Hardison when analyzing undue hardship under Title VII. A substantial body of case law has developed to guide that context-dependent analysis, and that case law provides meaningful protection to religious observants. Petitioner asks this Court to throw all that away and overrule Hardison. But he We'll hear argument next in Case -, United States versus Hansen. Mr. Fletcher. ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRIAN H.

Justice Sotomayor?Justice Kagan?Justice Gorsuch? Justice Kavanaugh? Justice Barrett? Justice Jackson?Thank you, counsel.Mr. Russell. ORAL ARGUMENT OF KEVIN K. RUSSELL ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTWell, he can't -- the reason he can't is because the statute says "such security." I mean, that's the big hurdle for you to get over. I -- I don't think the -- unless your argument is, and I'm not dismissing it in any sense, but it's simply a practicality argument, you say that Congress must have intended everybody to be able to sue and that we should not be too punctilious about looking at "such" in "such security."May not be the only one.

Not clearly domestic, but "dependent domestic nations" is a common term, I would say perhaps ---- the most common.You've mentioned a couple times the big four.Is there -- where has that been used before?Well, you're just saying that that -- there are collections of statutes where you see the four listed?Yeah.Well, I don't mean --It sounds a little bit like, you know, a college football poll, but there are -- there are others here that I can imagine in other contexts would think -- you'd think of them before you'd think of Indian tribes. I mean, it's United States, We'll hear argument first this morning in Case -, Pugin versus Garland, and the consolidated case. Mr. Gannon. ORAL ARGUMENT OF CURTIS E. GANNON ON BEHALF OF MERRICK B. GARLAND, ATTORNEY GENERALCounsel, one of the things that troubles me about both sides' position is the "relating to" language. It seems to me that to the extent you have a broad definition of "obstruction of justice," it becomes even broader when you say "relating to." And, of course, on the other side, the narrow definition -- I don't know that it takes adequate account of that. So I understand the formulation in your brief, but could you flesh out a little bit more about how "relating to" works, particularly against your fairly broad definition of obstruction?Well, but, I mean, if you -- if you -- we're dealing with a criminal statute here, and if you didn't have the Board's construction, would your -- what would your answer?Counsel --Okay. Why don't you finish your answer to Justice Sotomayor, and then I have a question.Counsel, looking at your reasonable foreseeability point, exactly what -- at what point do you -- do you We'll hear argument this morning in Case -, Yegiazaryan versus Smagin.

General Prelogar. ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. ELIZABETH B. PRELOGAR ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS GENERAL PRELOGAR: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: COVID- is the most devastating pandemic in our nation's history and it has caused enormous disruption and economic distress. Over the past three years, millions of Americans have struggled to pay rent, utilities, food, and many have been unable to pay their debts. To head off immediate harm for student-loan borrowers, two Secretaries across two administrations invoked the HEROES Act to suspend interest and payment obligations for all Americans with federally held loans. But, if that forbearance ends without further relief, it's undisputed that defaults and delinquencies will surge above pre-pandemic levels. We will hear argument, we'll continue argument, in Case -, Department of Education versus Brown. Welcome back. ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. ELIZABETH B. PRELOGAR ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS GENERAL PRELOGAR: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Across the board, Brown and Taylor's arguments in this case run counter to precedent and principle. On standing, Respondents' asserted injury is a complete mismatch for the relief they seek. They claim to want greater loan forgiveness than the plan provides, but they ask this Court to hold that the HEROES Act doesn't authorize loan forgiveness at all. A win on that theory would mean that no one could get any HEROES Act relief, not Brown, who would get nothing for herself, not Taylor, who would lose $,, and not any of the millions of borrowers who need this critical relief. Respondents lack standing to seek that result. Parties cannot go to court to make We'll hear argument this morning in Case -, United States versus Texas. General Prelogar. ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. ELIZABETH B. PRELOGAR ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS GENERAL PRELOGAR: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: There are more than million removable non-citizens in this country, and DHS has about , interior enforcement officers. To focus the agency's limited resources on threats to public safety, national security, and border security, DHS adopted enforcement priorities. But the district court issued a sweeping ruling vacating the guidelines nationwide. This Court should reverse. First, the states lack standing. They argue states can challenge any federal policy that imposes even one dollar of indirect harms on their own taxing or spending. That theory has no limiting principle. It's incompatible with our constitutional structure, and it We'll hear argument today in Case -, Financial Oversight and Management Board for Puerto Rico versus Centro de Periodismo Investigativo. Counsel. ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK D. HARRIS ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERYou analogize in your argument to the sovereign immunity of states, the sovereign immunity of -- of tribes, and I wonder if Puerto Rico's situation, though, is significantly different both with respect to states and with respect to tribes. They had sovereignty at the time of the convention, and that carried forward just as the states' carried forward, just as the tribes' carried forward. Puerto Rico, obviously, at some point at -- at points in the past had the sovereignty of Spain, but that did not carry over in any sense. It -- so the question would be not to the -- the extent to which the Constitution recognized the existing sovereignty. The question would be, did they -- the Constitution in any way confer sovereignty, create sovereignty, with respect to Puerto Rico? And, as far as the Plan of the Convention goes, the Plan of the Convention was to cover the territories with plenary authority on Congress's part, not with any notion of sovereignty.

Where -- where is -- where is all the money? Is it the money orders and traveler's checks or the big bank check -- checks?Yeah, but the question there I guess is how many of them there We'll hear argument first this morning -- well, this morning, in Original Case , New York versus New Jersey. Ms. Vale. ORAL ARGUMENT OF JUDITH N. VALE ON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFFYou said in your opening -- you said that the parties omitted a termination clause. But there's no evidence that they made a conscious decision to do that, is there? We're just dealing with a situation where, as far as we know, they didn't address the issue at all?Well, but that's a whole different level of -- of cooperation. The whole port, that's a lot of stuff going on. This is a very important but relatively small enterprise dealing with a particular problem.

You are allowed to take in consideration what a faculty recommender said. You know, one of the things that, you know, this applicant would bring is how to deal with racial discrimination in an area or in a school where he's part of a very small minority. Is there any -- do you have any objection to that sort of introduction of -- of race on behalf of a particular applicant?Thank you, counsel.

WAXMAN ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTJustice -- Justice Alito would like to ask a question.Thank you, counsel.We'll get to you in a moment. There's been a lot of talk about African American applicants to Harvard in sort of a general indistinguishable way when, in fact, they cover a very broad swath of -- of applicants.What do you do with respect to an African American applicant? I mean, you're concerned about diversity of viewpoint. Let's say his viewpoints tend to be very close to, you know, the white applicants, he grew up in Grosse Point, you know, had a great upbringing, comfortable, his parents went to Harvard, he's a legacy, and yet, under your system, when he checks African American, he gets a -- a tip. He gets a benefit from that. Isn't that ---- isn't that very stereotypical on -- under the Harvard program?I can't see it because it's far away. But, I mean -- (Laughter.)-- it is not zero.Well, so there's only a little racial discrimination in the case.Well, isn't that ---- isn't that what is -- Mr. Waxman, isn't that what the case is about, the discrimination against Asian Americans?

GEYSER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERWell --I -- I was just going to say, however many times it comes up in general, this was a specific case in which the government makes a strong argument that the facts did change and changed dramatically. The United States jumped in when they -- when the extent of the burden in terms of the documents they would have to review became clear and when also the -- at least some questionable conduct of your client with respect to discovery came to light.Sure.Thank you, counsel.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF FREDERICK LIU ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT UNITED STATESMr. Liu, it -- it -- your case would be easier for you, maybe for us, if your client had a more robust view of Article II. I was surprised it's cited only once in your brief, you know, on page . We're talking about the government's ability to control a suit with billions of dollars of money defrauded against federal law according to the allegations, and yet you're -- you're not arguing much about the President's authority to enforce that -- that statute at all.Well, that depends upon your prevailing in -- in this case. I mean, if you don't, then your authority to control the action would be significantly circumscribed.Justice Thomas, anything further?

McCOY ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERSCounsel, you and your friend on the other side both rely on this Court's opinion in -- in Beggerly, and I -- I'm not sure why it matters to you whether it's a jurisdictional ruling or simply a ruling about equitable estoppel. Either way -- I mean, maybe you're right on jurisdiction, maybe you're not right on jurisdiction, but either way you lose because the one thing Beggerly was quite clear about was that there was no equitable estoppel. It went through and gave the reasons for that under the Quiet Title Act. Which your client is looking for is equitable estoppel because you didn't meet the -- satisfy the timeline. But whether you're right in Beggerly about jurisdiction or not, you still lose, right?Yeah, but they're going to -- they're -- they're not going to have any trouble carrying that burden because Beggerly says quite clearly that whether -- whether jurisdictional or not, you -- you don't get -- years is years. You don't get beyond that.Well, if you're looking at the ways it's used, does it make a difference -- I mean, certainly, we've articulate -- correctly set forth the test that we've articulated, and it makes -- the application is pretty direct going forward.

Doesn't International Shoe sort of relegate that body of cases to the dust bin of history?Well, International Shoe, I mean, the fact that they didn't have a footnote saying, oh, all these other cases inconsistent with our approach have been overruled doesn't mean that they're any less -- no longer good law.Thank you, We'll hear argument next in Case -, Ciminelli versus United States.

I mean, the Secretary doesn't even know, the Commissioner, that you have accounts or that you're out there, and yet the -- the listing only one account would seem to me to be, you know, a -- mistaken under your view, but at least the Secretary is aware that you're out there and -- and have foreign accounts.

Your focus is on the actual selection and recommendations. They're responsible that a particular item is there but not for what the item -- item says. And I -- I don't -- I -- I think part -- it may be significant if the algorithm is the same across -- as Justice Thomas was suggesting, across the different subject matters, because then they don't have a focused algorithm with respect to terrorist activities or -- or pilaf or something, and then I think it might be harder for you to say that there's selection involved for which they could be held responsible.Thank you, counsel. Just one short question. Your -- your friend on the other side presented an analogy that she thought would be helpful, which -- a book seller that has a table with sports books on it, and somebody comes in and says, I'm looking for the book about, you know, Roger Maris, and the bookseller says, well, it's over there on the table with the other sports books.

(Laughter.)If your -- if your client's website was the same as it is, but the only indication of any limitation was a tag line at the end saying these services are for heterosexual couples only, could that constitutionally be applied under the Colorado statute?No, no. Well, no -- as in your case, no websites. No websites are available for -- except for heterosexual couples.Yeah, same thing.Okay. What if it said, I -- I won't provide websites for anything other than heterosexual marriages because of religious reasons? Could that be covered, or is it simply the invocation of religious basis for the objection that protects it from coverage under the statute?I -- I guess I don't understand that answer.

Mr. Robbins. ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE S. ROBBINS ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERSWhat do you mean -- what do you mean by "system commands"?No, I -- I -- I -- I think you have a stronger argument on "promote," though, than you have on "protect."And -- and the -- the -- the statute uses both and then, you know, lists a variety of rights. And it seems to me that if you're supposed to protect those rights and you're the person who's responsible for conferring -- living up to those rights, that -- that seems to me that it ought to be sufficiently direct under -- under Blessing or Gonzaga or any of the others.Thank you, counsel.I just have one last question. On the alternative remedy for grievances, does it matter that what you rely on the most is an administrative regulation rather than the statutory language? Because, obviously, the statutory language, you can analyze that as what the state had -- was on notice about or -- or not, but I don't know that that's true with respect to subsequent regulations.Well, I -- I -- I would contest that proposition since the We will hear argument next in Case -, Cruz versus Arizona. Mr. Katyal. ORAL ARGUMENT OF NEAL K. KATYAL ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERCounsel, you phrased this and present it, for understandable reasons, as hostility to a particular federal rule. But you can also look at it as a neutral rule, a procedural rule. I mean, the state doesn't have to provide collateral review of this particular claim, and they're -- they've decided they're not going to. And you -- and that doesn't exhibit hostility. It's just shaping the availability of collateral review, just as AEDPA does in the federal system.Thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas, anything further? Justice Alito?Justice Kagan? Okay. Thank you, counsel. Mr. Kanefield. ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH A. KANEFIELD ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTThank you, counsel. You said in response to a question that Arizona courts may not deny federal rights. You correctly answered yes.But isn't the issue here whether the Arizona -- Arizona can limit the availability of collateral review to particular types of claims?

The message is different.Well, what I guess I'm trying to suggest is that there may be nothing left to -- to the original author for derivative works. I mean, if that's not a derivative work, it's hard to see what would be.Yeah. Thank you, counsel. Under your test, you know, there are artists whose work consists of a single color within a frame, right? I'm sure you recognize those. And --Yeah. Mondrian, Albers.

MARTIN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERWell, it's a deeply rooted right that's traditionally defined by state law. You know, in some places, your property line goes up to the high water mark. In other states, it goes -- goes to the low water mark. And when you take property there, it's -- it's wherever the state law has defined it. What -- what if you -- Minnesota has a law sort of going forward and they say from now on, in Minnesota, if you get property, you have to know that we, the state, are going to take it if you don't pay taxes for three years? And people go in with that expectation. The market value is discounted because of that. If -- eventuality occurs, there's no taxes for three years, they take the property entirely, is that a taking or not?Well, then, if it's not defined by state law, what's it defined by?Well, there were states, I guess Virginia and Kentucky, that had a similar procedure as -- as Minnesota here today, you know, way back when, I guess before the founding or at the founding. Now, if you own property in Virginia and there was that basic -- I don't know if it's common law or statute in that -- that case -- would you have a takings claim if somebody acted -- if the state took your property consistent with a provision in law that had been in effect from the beginning?Well, back then, Virginia was hardly localized. I mean, it was a -- it was a large and important state, and I think the western bounds of it hadn't yet been defined, and different ---- different states had different rules, and -- and they chose to have a rule that had an exception to what today we might think of as common definition of property.What do you --I'm sorry, go ahead.Thank you, counsel.

We don't have to address the second issue, do we?Well, there might be -- there are differences between ADA cases, USERRA cases, Pregnancy Work Act cases. They apply to a fairly discrete category of individuals. Title VII, obviously, has a broader -- broader scope, and I'm wondering if that's the sort of issue that we need to address here when we -- it seems to me there's enough on our plate perhaps with respect to the undue burden standard.Justice Kagan.

I -- I don't think the -- unless your argument is, and I'm not dismissing it in any sense, but it's simply a practicality argument, you say that Congress must have intended everybody to be able to sue and that we should not be too punctilious about looking at "such" in "such security."May not be the only one.

GARLAND, ATTORNEY GENERALCounsel, one of the things that troubles me about both sides' position is the "relating to" language. It seems to me that to the extent you have a broad definition of "obstruction of justice," it becomes even broader when you say "relating to." And, of course, on the other side, the narrow definition -- I don't know that it takes adequate account of that. So I understand the formulation in your brief, but could you flesh out a little bit more about how "relating to" works, particularly against your fairly broad definition of obstruction?Well, but, I mean, if you -- if you -- we're dealing with a criminal statute here, and if you didn't have the Board's construction, would your -- what would your answer?Counsel --Okay.

General Prelogar. ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. ELIZABETH B. PRELOGAR ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS GENERAL PRELOGAR: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: COVID- is the most devastating pandemic in our nation's history and it has caused enormous disruption and economic distress. Over the past three years, millions of Americans have struggled to pay rent, utilities, food, and many have been unable to pay their debts. To head off immediate harm for student-loan borrowers, two Secretaries across two administrations invoked the HEROES Act to suspend interest and payment obligations for all Americans with federally held loans. But, if that forbearance ends without further relief, it's undisputed that defaults and delinquencies will surge above pre-pandemic levels. We will hear argument, we'll continue argument, in Case -, Department of Education versus Brown. Welcome back. ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. ELIZABETH B. PRELOGAR ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS GENERAL PRELOGAR: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Across the board, Brown and Taylor's arguments in this case run counter to precedent and principle. On standing, Respondents' asserted injury is a complete mismatch for the relief they seek. They claim to want greater loan forgiveness than the plan provides, but they ask this Court to hold that the HEROES Act doesn't authorize loan forgiveness at all. A win on that theory would mean that no one could get any HEROES Act relief, not Brown, who would get nothing for herself, not Taylor, who would lose $,, and not any of the millions of borrowers who need this critical relief. Respondents lack standing to seek that result. Parties cannot go to court to make We'll hear argument this morning in Case -, United States versus Texas. General Prelogar. ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. ELIZABETH B. PRELOGAR ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS GENERAL PRELOGAR: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: There are more than million removable non-citizens in this country, and DHS has about , interior enforcement officers. To focus the agency's limited resources on threats to public safety, national security, and border security, DHS adopted enforcement priorities. But the district court issued a sweeping ruling vacating the guidelines nationwide. This Court should reverse. First, the states lack standing. They argue states can challenge any federal policy that imposes even one dollar of indirect harms on their own taxing or spending. That theory has no limiting principle. It's incompatible with our constitutional structure, and it We'll hear argument today in Case -, Financial Oversight and Management Board for Puerto Rico versus Centro de Periodismo Investigativo. Counsel. ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK D. HARRIS ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERYou analogize in your argument to the sovereign immunity of states, the sovereign immunity of -- of tribes, and I wonder if Puerto Rico's situation, though, is significantly different both with respect to states and with respect to tribes. They had sovereignty at the time of the convention, and that carried forward just as the states' carried forward, just as the tribes' carried forward. Puerto Rico, obviously, at some point at -- at points in the past had the sovereignty of Spain, but that did not carry over in any sense. It -- so the question would be not to the -- the extent to which the Constitution recognized the existing sovereignty. The question would be, did they -- the Constitution in any way confer sovereignty, create sovereignty, with respect to Puerto Rico? And, as far as the Plan of the Convention goes, the Plan of the Convention was to cover the territories with plenary authority on Congress's part, not with any notion of sovereignty.

I mean, you're concerned about diversity of viewpoint. Let's say his viewpoints tend to be very close to, you know, the white applicants, he grew up in Grosse Point, you know, had a great upbringing, comfortable, his parents went to Harvard, he's a legacy, and yet, under your system, when he checks African American, he gets a -- a tip. He gets a benefit from that. Isn't that ---- isn't that very stereotypical on -- under the Harvard program?I can't see it because it's far away. But, I mean -- (Laughter.)-- it is not zero.Well, so there's only a little racial discrimination in the case.Well, isn't that ---- isn't that what is -- Mr. Waxman, isn't that what the case is about, the discrimination against Asian Americans?

McCOY ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERSCounsel, you and your friend on the other side both rely on this Court's opinion in -- in Beggerly, and I -- I'm not sure why it matters to you whether it's a jurisdictional ruling or simply a ruling about equitable estoppel. Either way -- I mean, maybe you're right on jurisdiction, maybe you're not right on jurisdiction, but either way you lose because the one thing Beggerly was quite clear about was that there was no equitable estoppel. It went through and gave the reasons for that under the Quiet Title Act. Which your client is looking for is equitable estoppel because you didn't meet the -- satisfy the timeline. But whether you're right in Beggerly about jurisdiction or not, you still lose, right?Yeah, but they're going to -- they're -- they're not going to have any trouble carrying that burden because Beggerly says quite clearly that whether -- whether jurisdictional or not, you -- you don't get -- years is years. You don't get beyond that.Well, if you're looking at the ways it's used, does it make a difference -- I mean, certainly, we've articulate -- correctly set forth the test that we've articulated, and it makes -- the application is pretty direct going forward.

HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERDoes your argument depend upon there being issues that could be raised that do not go to the authorization of the sale or lease? In other words, I understand the argument that this doesn't bar jurisdiction across the waterfront, but it does seem to bar any further inquiry into the validity of the sale or lease. No?So ---- so what would you have left apart from the issues of waiver?Thank you.

Justice Thomas? Justice Alito?Justice We'll hear argument this morning in Case -, Gonzalez versus Google. Mr. Schnapper. ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC SCHNAPPER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERSWell, but, I mean, the -- the -- the difference is that the Google, You -- YouTube, they're still not responsible for the content of the videos or -- or text that is transmitted. Your focus is on the actual selection and recommendations. They're responsible that a particular item is there but not for what the item -- item says. And I -- I don't -- I -- I think part -- it may be significant if the algorithm is the same across -- as Justice Thomas was suggesting, across the different subject matters, because then they don't have a focused algorithm with respect to terrorist activities or -- or pilaf or something, and then I think it might be harder for you to say that there's selection involved for which they could be held responsible.Thank you, counsel. Just one short question. Your -- your friend on the other side presented an analogy that she thought would be helpful, which -- a book seller that has a table with sports books on it, and somebody comes in and says, I'm looking for the book about, you know, Roger Maris, and the bookseller says, well, it's over there on the table with the other sports books. Isn't that analogous to what's happening here? You type in ISIS --Well, we'll figure out where we get -- it gets us in a minute. But I just want to know if you think that's a good -- a good analogy.That's what we call -- that's what we call questions.What lies ahead is, "I give up, Your Honor."Yeah.No, what lies ahead is the idea that you could look at that and say it's not pitching something in particular to the person who's made the request. It is recognizing that it's a request about a particular subject matter and it's there on the table, and they might want to look at that or We will hear argument first this morning in Case -, In re Grand Jury. Mr. Levin. ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL B. LEVIN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERWell --Well, I mean, "bona fide" means good faith, right? I mean, let's say you've got five different legal arguments, you know, one, two, three, four, five is bona fide. It's in good faith. Maybe it'll work; maybe it won't. Is that document privileged in that situation?Well, I know, but that -- yes, but you can affect how that determination is going to be made, I guess, by throwing in every reason you can. You know, should I -- should I put -- you know, a client says, should I put in this amount or that amount? And you go through an analysis, well, maybe this, maybe that, and then, you know, just -- even if you've only got a percent chance of -- of prevailing, it could still be bona fide. And does that cover the -- does that change the communication from sort of an accounting one to a legal one?Well, look -- I don't mean to interrupt -- We'll hear argument first this morning in Case -, San -- Santos-Zacaria versus Garland.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF NOEL J. FRANCISCO ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERYour -- the Board, of course, says that you should, I guess, bring your claim under the rubric of the failure to take reasonable precautions to preserve property.

Justice Barrett?Justice Jackson?Thank you, counsel. Mr. Suri. ORAL ARGUMENT OF VIVEK SURI FOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING NEITHER PARTYYou ---- you think, if I understand the position correctly, that Garmon does not cover the failure to take reasonable precautions to protect property, right?Well, it seems to me that if it doesn't cover that, it surely cannot cover the intentional destruction of property. Does that seem reasonable?Well, I -- just to make sure you're -- we're walking down the same road here, what I'm looking for is reasons that intentional destruction of property would not follow a fortiori from failure to take reasonable precautions to We will hear argument next in Case -, Turkiye Halk Bankasi versus United States. Ms. Blatt. ORAL ARGUMENT OF LISA S. BLATT ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERMs. Blatt, if -- if we accept your arguments when it's applied to sovereigns as such, is there any way to distinguish those arguments when it comes to a percent commercial enterprise that may or -- may or may not even be identified as associated with the sovereign, but the sovereign owns one more share than the -- to -- to form a majority?Why not? I mean, it's ---- percent to control and -- and ownership and all that.So you're saying they would choose? There's some where they're going to say this is us and others where they're going to say we just happen to own majority of the shares?Justice Thomas, anything? Justice Alito?

Mr. Waxman. ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERWell, if I could just --Okay.You gave a variety of considerations to take into account in response to Justice Thomas's hypothetical, but it seems to me that given the facts, you ought to be able to give us a bottom line or not. Would that be covered by the statute or not?Right. The facts he gave, the friend who he knew was committing all these crimes and all that, and he gave him a gun. Now is that covered or not?Well, I'm just trying to get you to answer. It seems a pretty direct case. Would it be fair to infer that he intended to use it for that -- for that purpose We will hear argument first this morning in Case -, Smith versus United States. Mr. Deger-Sen.

Mr. Barney. ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES R. BARNEY ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERCounsel, I think it was wise of you to mention (b)() in your opening because I think that's the biggest hurdle you've got to get over, and it's a situation where Congress specifically addressed tolling in a case of disability preventing a timely filing. Now you say, well, that was only for disability pensions. It had nothing to do and your case is, of course, service-connected. But, you know, at least they were addressing that particular issue, and it seems odd to me to have express -- I don't know whether it's tolling, right, in -- in -- in the one provision, but another one which is the same We'll hear argument next in Case -, Reed versus Goertz. Mr. Rider-Longmaid. ORAL ARGUMENT OF PARKER RIDER-LONGMAID ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERWell, that ---- so, I mean, you want to have your cake and eat it too. My -- my concern with your position would be that it's going to put off the time when people can bring claims for access to evidence because the claim is not going to be complete until you have the final decision by the CCA under your view, which helps you because you want to put off, you know, the time at which this is -- because We will hear argument first this morning in Case -, Sackett versus EPA.

(Laughter.)If your -- if your client's website was the same as it is, but the only indication of any limitation was a tag line at the end saying these services are for heterosexual couples only, could that constitutionally be applied under the Colorado statute?No, no. Well, no -- as in your case, no websites. No websites are available for -- except for heterosexual couples.Yeah, same thing.Okay. What if it said, I -- I won't provide websites for anything other than heterosexual marriages because of religious reasons? Could that be covered, or is it simply the invocation of religious basis for the objection that protects it from coverage under the statute?I -- I guess I don't understand that answer. In other words, is it simply adding for religious reasons to the label that would change whether it's -- could be We will hear argument first this morning in Case -, Students for Fair Admissions versus the University of North Carolina.

Mr. Robbins. ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE S. ROBBINS ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERSWhat do you mean -- what do you mean by "system commands"?No, I -- I -- I -- I think you have a stronger argument on "promote," though, than you have on "protect."And -- and the -- the -- the statute uses both and then, you know, lists a variety of rights. And it seems to me that if you're supposed to protect those rights and you're the person who's responsible for conferring -- living up to those rights, that -- that seems to me that it ought to be sufficiently direct under -- under Blessing or Gonzaga or any of the others.Thank you, counsel.I just have one last question. On the alternative remedy for grievances, does it matter that what you rely on the most is an administrative regulation rather than the statutory language? Because, obviously, the statutory language, you can analyze that as what the state had -- was on notice about or -- or not, but I don't know that that's true with respect to subsequent regulations.Well, I -- I -- I would contest that proposition since the We will hear argument next in Case -, Cruz versus Arizona. Mr. Katyal. ORAL ARGUMENT OF NEAL K. KATYAL ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERCounsel, you phrased this and present it, for understandable reasons, as hostility to a particular federal rule. But you can also look at it as a neutral rule, a procedural rule. I mean, the state doesn't have to provide collateral review of this particular claim, and they're -- they've decided they're not going to. And you -- and that doesn't exhibit hostility. It's just shaping the availability of collateral review, just as AEDPA does in the federal system.Thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas, anything further? Justice Alito?Justice Kagan? Okay. Thank you, counsel. Mr. Kanefield. ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH A. KANEFIELD ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTThank you, counsel. You said in response to a question that Arizona courts may not deny federal rights. You correctly answered yes.But isn't the issue here whether the Arizona -- Arizona can limit the availability of collateral review to particular types of claims? That's a very different question, isn't it?Either one works.Thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas? Justice Alito?Justice Sotomayor? Justice Kagan? No? Thank you, counsel.

You put a little smile on his face and say this is a new message. The message is Prince can be happy. Prince should be happy. Is that enough of a transformation? The message is different.Well, what I guess I'm trying to suggest is that there may be nothing left to -- to the original author for derivative works. I mean, if that's not a derivative work, it's hard to see what would be.Yeah. Thank you, counsel. Under your test, you know, there are artists whose work consists of a single color within a frame, right? I'm sure you recognize those. And --Yeah. Mondrian, Albers.

MARTIN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERWell, it's a deeply rooted right that's traditionally defined by state law. You know, in some places, your property line goes up to the high water mark. In other states, it goes -- goes to the low water mark. And when you take property there, it's -- it's wherever the state law has defined it. What -- what if you -- Minnesota has a law sort of going forward and they say from now on, in Minnesota, if you get property, you have to know that we, the state, are going to take it if you don't pay taxes for three years? And people go in with that expectation. The market value is discounted because of that. If -- eventuality occurs, there's no taxes for three years, they take the property entirely, is that a taking or not?Well, then, if it's not defined by state law, what's it defined by?Well, there were states, I guess Virginia and Kentucky, that had a similar procedure as -- as Minnesota here today, you know, way back when, I guess before the founding or at the founding. Now, if you own property in Virginia and there was that basic -- I don't know if it's common law or statute in that -- that case -- would you have a takings claim if somebody acted -- if the state took your property consistent with a provision in law that had been in effect from the beginning?Well, back then, Virginia was hardly localized. I mean, it was a -- it was a large and important state, and I think the western bounds of it hadn't yet been defined, and different ---- different states had different rules, and -- and they chose to have a rule that had an exception to what today we might think of as common definition of property.What do you --I'm sorry, go ahead.Thank you, counsel. We'll hear argument first this morning in Case -, Groff versus the Postmaster General, Louis DeJoy. Mr. Streett. ORAL ARGUMENT OF AARON STREETT ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERIt's -- it seems to me we might be getting a little ahead of ourselves in talking about the ADA standard or -- or some others. The first question presented just says whether or not the test applied in -- in Hardison is an appropriate test, their interpretation of undue burden. We don't have to address the second issue, do we?Well, there might be -- there are differences between ADA cases, USERRA cases, Pregnancy Work Act cases. They apply to a fairly discrete category of individuals. Title VII, obviously, has a broader -- broader scope, and I'm wondering if that's the sort of issue that we need to address here when we -- it seems to me there's enough on our plate perhaps with respect to the undue burden standard.Justice Kagan.

I -- I don't think the -- unless your argument is, and I'm not dismissing it in any sense, but it's simply a practicality argument, you say that Congress must have intended everybody to be able to sue and that we should not be too punctilious about looking at "such" in "such security."May not be the only one.

I mean, you're concerned about diversity of viewpoint. Let's say his viewpoints tend to be very close to, you know, the white applicants, he grew up in Grosse Point, you know, had a great upbringing, comfortable, his parents went to Harvard, he's a legacy, and yet, under your system, when he checks African American, he gets a -- a tip. He gets a benefit from that. Isn't that ---- isn't that very stereotypical on -- under the Harvard program?I can't see it because it's far away.

In other words, the government didn't have a statutory right to intervene until -something. And yet, now you would join the government and say basically that they can bring the -- bring the suit to a halt at any time and, given the looseness of the standard that's being We'll hear argument first this morning in Case -, Merrill versus Milligan, and the consolidated case.

McCOY ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERSCounsel, you and your friend on the other side both rely on this Court's opinion in -- in Beggerly, and I -- I'm not sure why it matters to you whether it's a jurisdictional ruling or simply a ruling about equitable estoppel. Either way -- I mean, maybe you're right on jurisdiction, maybe you're not right on jurisdiction, but either way you lose because the one thing Beggerly was quite clear about was that there was no equitable estoppel. It went through and gave the reasons for that under the Quiet Title Act. Which your client is looking for is equitable estoppel because you didn't meet the -- satisfy the timeline. But whether you're right in Beggerly about jurisdiction or not, you still lose, right?Yeah, but they're going to -- they're -- they're not going to have any trouble carrying that burden because Beggerly says quite clearly that whether -- whether jurisdictional or not, you -- you don't get -- years is years. You don't get beyond that.Well, if you're looking at the ways it's used, does it make a difference -- I mean, certainly, we've articulate -- correctly set forth the test that we've articulated, and it makes -- the application is pretty direct going forward.

Mr. Keller. ORAL ARGUMENT OF ASHLEY C. KELLER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERWell, history -- history and tradition move on, and as Justice Scalia said in the Daimler case, you shouldn't put heavy reliance on precedents from the Pennoyer era. Doesn't International Shoe sort of relegate that body of cases to the dust bin of history?Well, International Shoe, I mean, the fact that they didn't have a footnote saying, oh, all these other cases inconsistent with our approach have been overruled doesn't mean that they're any less -- no longer good law.Thank you, We'll hear argument next in Case -, Ciminelli versus United States.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL L. GEYSER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERCounsel, if you -- am I right that under your view, if you don't file any report at all, say you have -- accounts, that's a $, fine?And if you file a report but list only one account, that's also a $, fine?Well, doesn't that seem -- I would think the failure to file at all is -- is more egregious. I mean, the Secretary doesn't even know, the Commissioner, that you have accounts or that you're out there, and yet the -- the listing only one account would seem to me to be, you know, a -- mistaken under your view, but at least the Secretary is aware that you're out there and -- and have foreign accounts. Don't you think it's a -- a problem that not filing at all and filing incomplete have the same fine?You can finish.Thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas?Justice Alito? Justice Sotomayor?Justice Kagan?

In other words, I understand the argument that this doesn't bar jurisdiction across the waterfront, but it does seem to bar any further inquiry into the validity of the sale or lease.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC SCHNAPPER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERSWell, but, I mean, the -- the -- the difference is that the Google, You -- YouTube, they're still not responsible for the content of the videos or -- or text that is transmitted. Your focus is on the actual selection and recommendations. They're responsible that a particular item is there but not for what the item -- item says. And I -- I don't -- I -- I think part -- it may be significant if the algorithm is the same across -- as Justice Thomas was suggesting, across the different subject matters, because then they don't have a focused algorithm with respect to terrorist activities or -- or pilaf or something, and then I think it might be harder for you to say that there's selection involved for which they could be held responsible.Thank you, counsel. Just one short question. Your -- your friend on the other side presented an analogy that she thought would be helpful, which -- a book seller that has a table with sports books on it, and somebody comes in and says, I'm looking for the book about, you know, Roger Maris, and the bookseller says, well, it's over there on the table with the other sports books. Isn't that analogous to what's happening here? You type in ISIS --Well, we'll figure out where we get -- it gets us in a minute. But I just want to know if you think that's a good -- a good analogy.That's what we call -- that's what we call questions.What lies ahead is, "I give up, Your Honor."Yeah.No, what lies ahead is the idea that you could look at that and say it's not pitching something in particular to the person who's made the request. It is recognizing that it's a request about a particular subject matter and it's there on the table, and they might want to look at that or We will hear argument first this morning in Case -, In re Grand Jury.

Is that document privileged in that situation?Well, I know, but that -- yes, but you can affect how that determination is going to be made, I guess, by throwing in every reason you can. You know, should I -- should I put -- you know, a client says, should I put in this amount or that amount? And you go through an analysis, well, maybe this, maybe that, and then, you know, just -- even if you've only got a percent chance of -- of prevailing, it could still be bona fide.

I mean, it's ---- percent to control and -- and ownership and all that.So you're saying they would choose?

Would that be covered by the statute or not?Right. The facts he gave, the friend who he knew was committing all these crimes and all that, and he gave him a gun.

Mr. Barney. ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES R. BARNEY ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERCounsel, I think it was wise of you to mention (b)() in your opening because I think that's the biggest hurdle you've got to get over, and it's a situation where Congress specifically addressed tolling in a case of disability preventing a timely filing. Now you say, well, that was only for disability pensions. It had nothing to do and your case is, of course, service-connected. But, you know, at least they were addressing that particular issue, and it seems odd to me to have express -- I don't know whether it's tolling, right, in -- in -- in the one provision, but another one which is the same We'll hear argument next in Case -, Reed versus Goertz.

(Laughter.)If your -- if your client's website was the same as it is, but the only indication of any limitation was a tag line at the end saying these services are for heterosexual couples only, could that constitutionally be applied under the Colorado statute?No, no. Well, no -- as in your case, no websites. No websites are available for -- except for heterosexual couples.Yeah, same thing.Okay. What if it said, I -- I won't provide websites for anything other than heterosexual marriages because of religious reasons? Could that be covered, or is it simply the invocation of religious basis for the objection that protects it from coverage under the statute?I -- I guess I don't understand that answer.

And it seems to me that if you're supposed to protect those rights and you're the person who's responsible for conferring -- living up to those rights, that -- that seems to me that it ought to be sufficiently direct under -- under Blessing or Gonzaga or any of the others.Thank you, counsel.I just have one last question. On the alternative remedy for grievances, does it matter that what you rely on the most is an administrative regulation rather than the statutory language? Because, obviously, the statutory language, you can analyze that as what the state had -- was on notice about or -- or not, but I don't know that that's true with respect to subsequent regulations.Well, I -- I -- I would contest that proposition since the We will hear argument next in Case -, Cruz versus Arizona. Mr. Katyal. ORAL ARGUMENT OF NEAL K. KATYAL ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERCounsel, you phrased this and present it, for understandable reasons, as hostility to a particular federal rule.

I mean, the state doesn't have to provide collateral review of this particular claim, and they're -- they've decided they're not going to. And you -- and that doesn't exhibit hostility. It's just shaping the availability of collateral review, just as AEDPA does in the federal system.Thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas, anything further? Justice Alito?Justice Kagan? Okay. Thank you, counsel. Mr. Kanefield. ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH A. KANEFIELD ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTThank you, counsel.

The message is different.Well, what I guess I'm trying to suggest is that there may be nothing left to -- to the original author for derivative works. I mean, if that's not a derivative work, it's hard to see what would be.Yeah. Thank you, counsel.

MARTIN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERWell, it's a deeply rooted right that's traditionally defined by state law. You know, in some places, your property line goes up to the high water mark. In other states, it goes -- goes to the low water mark. And when you take property there, it's -- it's wherever the state law has defined it. What -- what if you -- Minnesota has a law sort of going forward and they say from now on, in Minnesota, if you get property, you have to know that we, the state, are going to take it if you don't pay taxes for three years? And people go in with that expectation. The market value is discounted because of that. If -- eventuality occurs, there's no taxes for three years, they take the property entirely, is that a taking or not?Well, then, if it's not defined by state law, what's it defined by?Well, there were states, I guess Virginia and Kentucky, that had a similar procedure as -- as Minnesota here today, you know, way back when, I guess before the founding or at the founding. Now, if you own property in Virginia and there was that basic -- I don't know if it's common law or statute in that -- that case -- would you have a takings claim if somebody acted -- if the state took your property consistent with a provision in law that had been in effect from the beginning?Well, back then, Virginia was hardly localized. I mean, it was a -- it was a large and important state, and I think the western bounds of it hadn't yet been defined, and different ---- different states had different rules, and -- and they chose to have a rule that had an exception to what today we might think of as common definition of property.What do you --I'm sorry, go ahead.Thank you, counsel.

The first question presented just says whether or not the test applied in -- in Hardison is an appropriate test, their interpretation of undue burden. We don't have to address the second issue, do we?Well, there might be -- there are differences between ADA cases, USERRA cases, Pregnancy Work Act cases. They apply to a fairly discrete category of individuals. Title VII, obviously, has a broader -- broader scope, and I'm wondering if that's the sort of issue that we need to address here when we -- it seems to me there's enough on our plate perhaps with respect to the undue burden standard.Justice Kagan.

I -- I don't think the -- unless your argument is, and I'm not dismissing it in any sense, but it's simply a practicality argument, you say that Congress must have intended everybody to be able to sue and that we should not be too punctilious about looking at "such" in "such security."May not be the only one.

It seems to me that to the extent you have a broad definition of "obstruction of justice," it becomes even broader when you say "relating to." And, of course, on the other side, the narrow definition -- I don't know that it takes adequate account of that. So I understand the formulation in your brief, but could you flesh out a little bit more about how "relating to" works, particularly against your fairly broad definition of obstruction?Well, but, I mean, if you -- if you -- we're dealing with a criminal statute here, and if you didn't have the Board's construction, would your -- what would your answer?Counsel --Okay. Why don't you finish your answer to Justice Sotomayor, and then I have a question.Counsel, looking at your reasonable foreseeability point, exactly what -- at what point do you -- do you We'll hear argument this morning in Case -, Yegiazaryan versus Smagin.

General Prelogar. ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. ELIZABETH B. PRELOGAR ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS GENERAL PRELOGAR: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: COVID- is the most devastating pandemic in our nation's history and it has caused enormous disruption and economic distress. Over the past three years, millions of Americans have struggled to pay rent, utilities, food, and many have been unable to pay their debts. To head off immediate harm for student-loan borrowers, two Secretaries across two administrations invoked the HEROES Act to suspend interest and payment obligations for all Americans with federally held loans. But, if that forbearance ends without further relief, it's undisputed that defaults and delinquencies will surge above pre-pandemic levels. We will hear argument, we'll continue argument, in Case -, Department of Education versus Brown. Welcome back. ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. ELIZABETH B. PRELOGAR ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS GENERAL PRELOGAR: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Across the board, Brown and Taylor's arguments in this case run counter to precedent and principle. On standing, Respondents' asserted injury is a complete mismatch for the relief they seek. They claim to want greater loan forgiveness than the plan provides, but they ask this Court to hold that the HEROES Act doesn't authorize loan forgiveness at all. A win on that theory would mean that no one could get any HEROES Act relief, not Brown, who would get nothing for herself, not Taylor, who would lose $,, and not any of the millions of borrowers who need this critical relief. Respondents lack standing to seek that result. Parties cannot go to court to make We'll hear argument this morning in Case -, United States versus Texas. General Prelogar. ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. ELIZABETH B. PRELOGAR ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS GENERAL PRELOGAR: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: There are more than million removable non-citizens in this country, and DHS has about , interior enforcement officers. To focus the agency's limited resources on threats to public safety, national security, and border security, DHS adopted enforcement priorities. But the district court issued a sweeping ruling vacating the guidelines nationwide. This Court should reverse. First, the states lack standing. They argue states can challenge any federal policy that imposes even one dollar of indirect harms on their own taxing or spending. That theory has no limiting principle. It's incompatible with our constitutional structure, and it We'll hear argument today in Case -, Financial Oversight and Management Board for Puerto Rico versus Centro de Periodismo Investigativo. Counsel. ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK D. HARRIS ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERYou analogize in your argument to the sovereign immunity of states, the sovereign immunity of -- of tribes, and I wonder if Puerto Rico's situation, though, is significantly different both with respect to states and with respect to tribes. They had sovereignty at the time of the convention, and that carried forward just as the states' carried forward, just as the tribes' carried forward. Puerto Rico, obviously, at some point at -- at points in the past had the sovereignty of Spain, but that did not carry over in any sense. It -- so the question would be not to the -- the extent to which the Constitution recognized the existing sovereignty. The question would be, did they -- the Constitution in any way confer sovereignty, create sovereignty, with respect to Puerto Rico? And, as far as the Plan of the Convention goes, the Plan of the Convention was to cover the territories with plenary authority on Congress's part, not with any notion of sovereignty.

Where -- where is -- where is all the money? Is it the money orders and traveler's checks or the big bank check -- checks?Yeah, but the question there I guess is how many of them there We'll hear argument first this morning -- well, this morning, in Original Case , New York versus New Jersey. Ms. Vale. ORAL ARGUMENT OF JUDITH N. VALE ON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFFYou said in your opening -- you said that the parties omitted a termination clause. But there's no evidence that they made a conscious decision to do that, is there? We're just dealing with a situation where, as far as we know, they didn't address the issue at all?Well, but that's a whole different level of -- of cooperation. The whole port, that's a lot of stuff going on. This is a very important but relatively small enterprise dealing with a particular problem.

NORRIS ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERWould you have any objection if you do not ask candidates for admission to -- to check a box, what their race is, but you are allowed to take into consideration what an applicant would say in an -- in an essay about having to confront discrimination growing up and how he or she did that. You are allowed to take in consideration what a faculty recommender said. You know, one of the things that, you know, this applicant would bring is how to deal with racial discrimination in an area or in a school where he's part of a very small minority. Is there any -- do you have any objection to that sort of introduction of -- of race on behalf of a particular applicant?Thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas?Justice Alito?Anything further, Justice Kagan? Justice Kavanaugh?Justice Barrett?Thank you, counsel. Mr. Waxman. ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTJustice -- Justice Alito would like to ask a question.Thank you, counsel.We'll get to you in a moment. There's been a lot of talk about African American applicants to Harvard in sort of a general indistinguishable way when, in fact, they cover a very broad swath of -- of applicants.What do you do with respect to an African American applicant? I mean, you're concerned about diversity of viewpoint. Let's say his viewpoints tend to be very close to, you know, the white applicants, he grew up in Grosse Point, you know, had a great upbringing, comfortable, his parents went to Harvard, he's a legacy, and yet, under your system, when he checks African American, he gets a -- a tip. He gets a benefit from that. Isn't that ---- isn't that very stereotypical on -- under the Harvard program?I can't see it because it's far away. But, I mean -- (Laughter.)-- it is not zero.Well, so there's only a little racial discrimination in the case.Well, isn't that ---- isn't that what is -- Mr. Waxman, isn't that what the case is about, the discrimination against Asian Americans?

GEYSER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERWell --I -- I was just going to say, however many times it comes up in general, this was a specific case in which the government makes a strong argument that the facts did change and changed dramatically. The United States jumped in when they -- when the extent of the burden in terms of the documents they would have to review became clear and when also the -- at least some questionable conduct of your client with respect to discovery came to light.Sure.Thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas, any? Justice Alito?Justice --Justice Kagan? Justice Gorsuch?Justice Barrett? Justice Jackson?Thank you, counsel. Mr. Liu. ORAL ARGUMENT OF FREDERICK LIU ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT UNITED STATESMr. Liu, it -- it -- your case would be easier for you, maybe for us, if your client had a more robust view of Article II. I was surprised it's cited only once in your brief, you know, on page . We're talking about the government's ability to control a suit with billions of dollars of money defrauded against federal law according to the allegations, and yet you're -- you're not arguing much about the President's authority to enforce that -- that statute at all.Well, that depends upon your prevailing in -- in this case. I mean, if you don't, then your authority to control the action would be significantly circumscribed.Justice Thomas, anything further? Justice Alito?Justice Sotomayor?Justice Kagan?Justice Gorsuch?Justice Barrett? Justice Jackson?Thank you, counsel. Mr. Mosier. ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK W. MOSIER ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT EXECUTIVE HEALTH RESOURCES, INC.Counsel, is it consistent with the Congress's view of these sorts of actions, going back to , to continue to leave the entire proceeding in the hands of the government, which it would be under your theory? In other words, the government didn't have a statutory right to intervene until -something. And yet, now you would join the government and say basically that they can bring the -- bring the suit to a halt at any time and, given the looseness of the standard that's being We'll hear argument first this morning in Case -, Merrill versus Milligan, and the consolidated case.

McCOY ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERSCounsel, you and your friend on the other side both rely on this Court's opinion in -- in Beggerly, and I -- I'm not sure why it matters to you whether it's a jurisdictional ruling or simply a ruling about equitable estoppel. Either way -- I mean, maybe you're right on jurisdiction, maybe you're not right on jurisdiction, but either way you lose because the one thing Beggerly was quite clear about was that there was no equitable estoppel. It went through and gave the reasons for that under the Quiet Title Act. Which your client is looking for is equitable estoppel because you didn't meet the -- satisfy the timeline. But whether you're right in Beggerly about jurisdiction or not, you still lose, right?Yeah, but they're going to -- they're -- they're not going to have any trouble carrying that burden because Beggerly says quite clearly that whether -- whether jurisdictional or not, you -- you don't get -- years is years. You don't get beyond that.Well, if you're looking at the ways it's used, does it make a difference -- I mean, certainly, we've articulate -- correctly set forth the test that we've articulated, and it makes -- the application is pretty direct going forward.

Doesn't International Shoe sort of relegate that body of cases to the dust bin of history?Well, International Shoe, I mean, the fact that they didn't have a footnote saying, oh, all these other cases inconsistent with our approach have been overruled doesn't mean that they're any less -- no longer good law.Thank you, We'll hear argument next in Case -, Ciminelli versus United States.

I mean, the Secretary doesn't even know, the Commissioner, that you have accounts or that you're out there, and yet the -- the listing only one account would seem to me to be, you know, a -- mistaken under your view, but at least the Secretary is aware that you're out there and -- and have foreign accounts. Don't you think it's a -- a problem that not filing at all and filing incomplete have the same fine?You can finish.Thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas?Justice Alito? Justice Sotomayor?Justice Kagan?

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC SCHNAPPER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERSWell, but, I mean, the -- the -- the difference is that the Google, You -- YouTube, they're still not responsible for the content of the videos or -- or text that is transmitted. Your focus is on the actual selection and recommendations. They're responsible that a particular item is there but not for what the item -- item says. And I -- I don't -- I -- I think part -- it may be significant if the algorithm is the same across -- as Justice Thomas was suggesting, across the different subject matters, because then they don't have a focused algorithm with respect to terrorist activities or -- or pilaf or something, and then I think it might be harder for you to say that there's selection involved for which they could be held responsible.Thank you, counsel. Just one short question. Your -- your friend on the other side presented an analogy that she thought would be helpful, which -- a book seller that has a table with sports books on it, and somebody comes in and says, I'm looking for the book about, you know, Roger Maris, and the bookseller says, well, it's over there on the table with the other sports books. Isn't that analogous to what's happening here? You type in ISIS --Well, we'll figure out where we get -- it gets us in a minute. But I just want to know if you think that's a good -- a good analogy.That's what we call -- that's what we call questions.What lies ahead is, "I give up, Your Honor."Yeah.No, what lies ahead is the idea that you could look at that and say it's not pitching something in particular to the person who's made the request.

You know, should I -- should I put -- you know, a client says, should I put in this amount or that amount? And you go through an analysis, well, maybe this, maybe that, and then, you know, just -- even if you've only got a percent chance of -- of prevailing, it could still be bona fide.

Now you say, well, that was only for disability pensions. It had nothing to do and your case is, of course, service-connected.

Well, no -- as in your case, no websites. No websites are available for -- except for heterosexual couples.Yeah, same thing.Okay. What if it said, I -- I won't provide websites for anything other than heterosexual marriages because of religious reasons? Could that be covered, or is it simply the invocation of religious basis for the objection that protects it from coverage under the statute?I -- I guess I don't understand that answer.

And it seems to me that if you're supposed to protect those rights and you're the person who's responsible for conferring -- living up to those rights, that -- that seems to me that it ought to be sufficiently direct under -- under Blessing or Gonzaga or any of the others.Thank you, counsel.I just have one last question. On the alternative remedy for grievances, does it matter that what you rely on the most is an administrative regulation rather than the statutory language? Because, obviously, the statutory language, you can analyze that as what the state had -- was on notice about or -- or not, but I don't know that that's true with respect to subsequent regulations.Well, I -- I -- I would contest that proposition since the We will hear argument next in Case -, Cruz versus Arizona. Mr. Katyal. ORAL ARGUMENT OF NEAL K. KATYAL ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERCounsel, you phrased this and present it, for understandable reasons, as hostility to a particular federal rule.

I mean, the state doesn't have to provide collateral review of this particular claim, and they're -- they've decided they're not going to. And you -- and that doesn't exhibit hostility. It's just shaping the availability of collateral review, just as AEDPA does in the federal system.Thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas, anything further? Justice Alito?Justice Kagan? Okay.

MARTIN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERWell, it's a deeply rooted right that's traditionally defined by state law. You know, in some places, your property line goes up to the high water mark. In other states, it goes -- goes to the low water mark. And when you take property there, it's -- it's wherever the state law has defined it. What -- what if you -- Minnesota has a law sort of going forward and they say from now on, in Minnesota, if you get property, you have to know that we, the state, are going to take it if you don't pay taxes for three years? And people go in with that expectation. The market value is discounted because of that. If -- eventuality occurs, there's no taxes for three years, they take the property entirely, is that a taking or not?Well, then, if it's not defined by state law, what's it defined by?Well, there were states, I guess Virginia and Kentucky, that had a similar procedure as -- as Minnesota here today, you know, way back when, I guess before the founding or at the founding. Now, if you own property in Virginia and there was that basic -- I don't know if it's common law or statute in that -- that case -- would you have a takings claim if somebody acted -- if the state took your property consistent with a provision in law that had been in effect from the beginning?Well, back then, Virginia was hardly localized. I mean, it was a -- it was a large and important state, and I think the western bounds of it hadn't yet been defined, and different ---- different states had different rules, and -- and they chose to have a rule that had an exception to what today we might think of as common definition of property.What do you --I'm sorry, go ahead.Thank you, counsel. We'll hear argument first this morning in Case -, Groff versus the Postmaster General, Louis DeJoy. Mr. Streett. ORAL ARGUMENT OF AARON STREETT ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERIt's -- it seems to me we might be getting a little ahead of ourselves in talking about the ADA standard or -- or some others. The first question presented just says whether or not the test applied in -- in Hardison is an appropriate test, their interpretation of undue burden. We don't have to address the second issue, do we?Well, there might be -- there are differences between ADA cases, USERRA cases, Pregnancy Work Act cases. They apply to a fairly discrete category of individuals. Title VII, obviously, has a broader -- broader scope, and I'm wondering if that's the sort of issue that we need to address here when we -- it seems to me there's enough on our plate perhaps with respect to the undue burden standard.Justice Kagan.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. ELIZABETH B. PRELOGAR ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT GENERAL PRELOGAR: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: For almost years, courts have applied Hardison when analyzing undue hardship under Title VII.

Justice Sotomayor?Justice Kagan?Justice Gorsuch? Justice Kavanaugh? Justice Barrett? Justice Jackson?Thank you, counsel.Mr. Russell. ORAL ARGUMENT OF KEVIN K. RUSSELL ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTWell, he can't -- the reason he can't is because the statute says "such security." I mean, that's the big hurdle for you to get over. I -- I don't think the -- unless your argument is, and I'm not dismissing it in any sense, but it's simply a practicality argument, you say that Congress must have intended everybody to be able to sue and that we should not be too punctilious about looking at "such" in "such security."May not be the only one.

GARLAND, ATTORNEY GENERALCounsel, one of the things that troubles me about both sides' position is the "relating to" language. It seems to me that to the extent you have a broad definition of "obstruction of justice," it becomes even broader when you say "relating to." And, of course, on the other side, the narrow definition -- I don't know that it takes adequate account of that. So I understand the formulation in your brief, but could you flesh out a little bit more about how "relating to" works, particularly against your fairly broad definition of obstruction?Well, but, I mean, if you -- if you -- we're dealing with a criminal statute here, and if you didn't have the Board's construction, would your -- what would your answer?Counsel --Okay. Why don't you finish your answer to Justice Sotomayor, and then I have a question.Counsel, looking at your reasonable foreseeability point, exactly what -- at what point do you -- do you We'll hear argument this morning in Case -, Yegiazaryan versus Smagin.

General Prelogar. ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. ELIZABETH B. PRELOGAR ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS GENERAL PRELOGAR: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: COVID- is the most devastating pandemic in our nation's history and it has caused enormous disruption and economic distress. Over the past three years, millions of Americans have struggled to pay rent, utilities, food, and many have been unable to pay their debts. To head off immediate harm for student-loan borrowers, two Secretaries across two administrations invoked the HEROES Act to suspend interest and payment obligations for all Americans with federally held loans. But, if that forbearance ends without further relief, it's undisputed that defaults and delinquencies will surge above pre-pandemic levels. We will hear argument, we'll continue argument, in Case -, Department of Education versus Brown. Welcome back. ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. ELIZABETH B. PRELOGAR ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS GENERAL PRELOGAR: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Across the board, Brown and Taylor's arguments in this case run counter to precedent and principle. On standing, Respondents' asserted injury is a complete mismatch for the relief they seek. They claim to want greater loan forgiveness than the plan provides, but they ask this Court to hold that the HEROES Act doesn't authorize loan forgiveness at all. A win on that theory would mean that no one could get any HEROES Act relief, not Brown, who would get nothing for herself, not Taylor, who would lose $,, and not any of the millions of borrowers who need this critical relief. Respondents lack standing to seek that result. Parties cannot go to court to make We'll hear argument this morning in Case -, United States versus Texas. General Prelogar. ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. ELIZABETH B. PRELOGAR ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS GENERAL PRELOGAR: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: There are more than million removable non-citizens in this country, and DHS has about , interior enforcement officers. To focus the agency's limited resources on threats to public safety, national security, and border security, DHS adopted enforcement priorities. But the district court issued a sweeping ruling vacating the guidelines nationwide. This Court should reverse. First, the states lack standing. They argue states can challenge any federal policy that imposes even one dollar of indirect harms on their own taxing or spending. That theory has no limiting principle. It's incompatible with our constitutional structure, and it We'll hear argument today in Case -, Financial Oversight and Management Board for Puerto Rico versus Centro de Periodismo Investigativo. Counsel. ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK D. HARRIS ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERYou analogize in your argument to the sovereign immunity of states, the sovereign immunity of -- of tribes, and I wonder if Puerto Rico's situation, though, is significantly different both with respect to states and with respect to tribes. They had sovereignty at the time of the convention, and that carried forward just as the states' carried forward, just as the tribes' carried forward. Puerto Rico, obviously, at some point at -- at points in the past had the sovereignty of Spain, but that did not carry over in any sense. It -- so the question would be not to the -- the extent to which the Constitution recognized the existing sovereignty. The question would be, did they -- the Constitution in any way confer sovereignty, create sovereignty, with respect to Puerto Rico? And, as far as the Plan of the Convention goes, the Plan of the Convention was to cover the territories with plenary authority on Congress's part, not with any notion of sovereignty.

You are allowed to take in consideration what a faculty recommender said. You know, one of the things that, you know, this applicant would bring is how to deal with racial discrimination in an area or in a school where he's part of a very small minority.

There's been a lot of talk about African American applicants to Harvard in sort of a general indistinguishable way when, in fact, they cover a very broad swath of -- of applicants.What do you do with respect to an African American applicant? I mean, you're concerned about diversity of viewpoint. Let's say his viewpoints tend to be very close to, you know, the white applicants, he grew up in Grosse Point, you know, had a great upbringing, comfortable, his parents went to Harvard, he's a legacy, and yet, under your system, when he checks African American, he gets a -- a tip. He gets a benefit from that. Isn't that ---- isn't that very stereotypical on -- under the Harvard program?I can't see it because it's far away. But, I mean -- (Laughter.)-- it is not zero.Well, so there's only a little racial discrimination in the case.Well, isn't that ---- isn't that what is -- Mr. Waxman, isn't that what the case is about, the discrimination against Asian Americans?

I was surprised it's cited only once in your brief, you know, on page . We're talking about the government's ability to control a suit with billions of dollars of money defrauded against federal law according to the allegations, and yet you're -- you're not arguing much about the President's authority to enforce that -- that statute at all.Well, that depends upon your prevailing in -- in this case.

McCOY ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERSCounsel, you and your friend on the other side both rely on this Court's opinion in -- in Beggerly, and I -- I'm not sure why it matters to you whether it's a jurisdictional ruling or simply a ruling about equitable estoppel. Either way -- I mean, maybe you're right on jurisdiction, maybe you're not right on jurisdiction, but either way you lose because the one thing Beggerly was quite clear about was that there was no equitable estoppel. It went through and gave the reasons for that under the Quiet Title Act. Which your client is looking for is equitable estoppel because you didn't meet the -- satisfy the timeline. But whether you're right in Beggerly about jurisdiction or not, you still lose, right?Yeah, but they're going to -- they're -- they're not going to have any trouble carrying that burden because Beggerly says quite clearly that whether -- whether jurisdictional or not, you -- you don't get -- years is years. You don't get beyond that.Well, if you're looking at the ways it's used, does it make a difference -- I mean, certainly, we've articulate -- correctly set forth the test that we've articulated, and it makes -- the application is pretty direct going forward.

Just one short question.

There's some where they're going to say this is us and others where they're going to say we just happen to own majority of the shares?Justice Thomas, anything? Justice Alito?

Would that be covered by the statute or not?Right. The facts he gave, the friend who he knew was committing all these crimes and all that, and he gave him a gun. Now is that covered or not?Well, I'm just trying to get you to answer. It seems a pretty direct case.

Mr. Barney. ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES R. BARNEY ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERCounsel, I think it was wise of you to mention (b)() in your opening because I think that's the biggest hurdle you've got to get over, and it's a situation where Congress specifically addressed tolling in a case of disability preventing a timely filing. Now you say, well, that was only for disability pensions. It had nothing to do and your case is, of course, service-connected. But, you know, at least they were addressing that particular issue, and it seems odd to me to have express -- I don't know whether it's tolling, right, in -- in -- in the one provision, but another one which is the same We'll hear argument next in Case -, Reed versus Goertz.

(Laughter.)If your -- if your client's website was the same as it is, but the only indication of any limitation was a tag line at the end saying these services are for heterosexual couples only, could that constitutionally be applied under the Colorado statute?No, no. Well, no -- as in your case, no websites. No websites are available for -- except for heterosexual couples.Yeah, same thing.Okay. What if it said, I -- I won't provide websites for anything other than heterosexual marriages because of religious reasons? Could that be covered, or is it simply the invocation of religious basis for the objection that protects it from coverage under the statute?I -- I guess I don't understand that answer.

ROBBINS ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERSWhat do you mean -- what do you mean by "system commands"?No, I -- I -- I -- I think you have a stronger argument on "promote," though, than you have on "protect."And -- and the -- the -- the statute uses both and then, you know, lists a variety of rights. And it seems to me that if you're supposed to protect those rights and you're the person who's responsible for conferring -- living up to those rights, that -- that seems to me that it ought to be sufficiently direct under -- under Blessing or Gonzaga or any of the others.Thank you, counsel.I just have one last question. On the alternative remedy for grievances, does it matter that what you rely on the most is an administrative regulation rather than the statutory language? Because, obviously, the statutory language, you can analyze that as what the state had -- was on notice about or -- or not, but I don't know that that's true with respect to subsequent regulations.Well, I -- I -- I would contest that proposition since the We will hear argument next in Case -, Cruz versus Arizona. Mr. Katyal. ORAL ARGUMENT OF NEAL K. KATYAL ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERCounsel, you phrased this and present it, for understandable reasons, as hostility to a particular federal rule. But you can also look at it as a neutral rule, a procedural rule. I mean, the state doesn't have to provide collateral review of this particular claim, and they're -- they've decided they're not going to. And you -- and that doesn't exhibit hostility. It's just shaping the availability of collateral review, just as AEDPA does in the federal system.Thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas, anything further? Justice Alito?Justice Kagan? Okay. Thank you, counsel. Mr. Kanefield. ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH A. KANEFIELD ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTThank you, counsel. You said in response to a question that Arizona courts may not deny federal rights. You correctly answered yes.But isn't the issue here whether the Arizona -- Arizona can limit the availability of collateral review to particular types of claims?

You put a little smile on his face and say this is a new message. The message is Prince can be happy. Prince should be happy. Is that enough of a transformation? The message is different.Well, what I guess I'm trying to suggest is that there may be nothing left to -- to the original author for derivative works. I mean, if that's not a derivative work, it's hard to see what would be.Yeah. Thank you, counsel. Under your test, you know, there are artists whose work consists of a single color within a frame, right? I'm sure you recognize those. And --Yeah. Mondrian, Albers.

MARTIN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERWell, it's a deeply rooted right that's traditionally defined by state law. You know, in some places, your property line goes up to the high water mark. In other states, it goes -- goes to the low water mark. And when you take property there, it's -- it's wherever the state law has defined it. What -- what if you -- Minnesota has a law sort of going forward and they say from now on, in Minnesota, if you get property, you have to know that we, the state, are going to take it if you don't pay taxes for three years? And people go in with that expectation. The market value is discounted because of that. If -- eventuality occurs, there's no taxes for three years, they take the property entirely, is that a taking or not?Well, then, if it's not defined by state law, what's it defined by?Well, there were states, I guess Virginia and Kentucky, that had a similar procedure as -- as Minnesota here today, you know, way back when, I guess before the founding or at the founding. Now, if you own property in Virginia and there was that basic -- I don't know if it's common law or statute in that -- that case -- would you have a takings claim if somebody acted -- if the state took your property consistent with a provision in law that had been in effect from the beginning?Well, back then, Virginia was hardly localized. I mean, it was a -- it was a large and important state, and I think the western bounds of it hadn't yet been defined, and different ---- different states had different rules, and -- and they chose to have a rule that had an exception to what today we might think of as common definition of property.What do you --I'm sorry, go ahead.Thank you, counsel.

The first question presented just says whether or not the test applied in -- in Hardison is an appropriate test, their interpretation of undue burden. We don't have to address the second issue, do we?Well, there might be -- there are differences between ADA cases, USERRA cases, Pregnancy Work Act cases. They apply to a fairly discrete category of individuals. Title VII, obviously, has a broader -- broader scope, and I'm wondering if that's the sort of issue that we need to address here when we -- it seems to me there's enough on our plate perhaps with respect to the undue burden standard.Justice Kagan.

I -- I don't think the -- unless your argument is, and I'm not dismissing it in any sense, but it's simply a practicality argument, you say that Congress must have intended everybody to be able to sue and that we should not be too punctilious about looking at "such" in "such security."May not be the only one.

PRELOGAR ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS GENERAL PRELOGAR: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Fifth Circuit's decision in this case is the first time any court in our nation's history has held that Congress violated the Appropriations Clause by enacting a statute providing funding. This Court should uphold the CFPB's funding statute because it is firmly grounded in constitutional text and in historical practice dating back to the founding.

WALL ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERYour -- your argument, I take it, is that there is an established federal maritime rule not simply on choice-of-law provisions but, I don't know, the Uberrimae Fidei doctrine, in other words, that even if your boat runs aground, you know, if you didn't have the fire extinguisher, you know, updated, you -- you lose. What if there weren't an established maritime policy on that specific doctrine?Well, I wonder if it --I was just going to say -- sorry to interrupt -- but, I mean, certainly, the argument can be made -- and I -- I think it's the argument of your friend on the other side -- that Wilburn Boat is expressly designed to do what you indicated that it doesn't matter, which is, if you have a very particular question like how the insurance policy should be interpreted, and there's no federal rule. There are general federal rules about choice-of-law, you know, but not the particular question there. We'll hear argument this morning in Case -, Culley versus Marshall. Mr. Dvoretzky.

And as I understand it, you basically say, if you've got percent government, then we, the government, can basically say the whole thing, even if the rest of it is all about your children and -- and -- and the dogs, that's ours.

Whether that has resulted in an injury, whether it's caused it is -- is a different question. Now your position merges those two, right? You don't separately look for liability and causation?Well, that's causation. And I think your friend on the other side draws the sharp distinction between liability and causation.

The federal government, in association with the states, built the interstate highway system, an enormous benefit to members of the public. Could the government decide that accidents interfere with what they were trying to accomplish in the highway system and create an agency to hear and adjudicate who's liable, responsible, and how much for accidents on the highway system? No court, no jury?Well, only -- only on a system where they gave the benefit which those people that have the accidents are taking advantage of. I understood that to be part of the aspect of the public rights doctrine.So -- so what about healthcare? The government's involved in the healthcare sector. Could an agency determine that the cost of medical malpractice claims throughout healthcare, not just the particular aspect which the government's participating in, interferes with what they're trying to accomplish in the healthcare system, and so the subject of medical malpractice will be handled by a government agency, an expert We'll hear argument this morning in Case -, Rudisill versus McDonough, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs. Mr. Tseytlin. ORAL ARGUMENT OF MISHA TSEYTLIN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERIt may make --I'm sorry? I was just going to say it may make some sense into -- in what they probably envisioned was the normal situation, where you had the overlapping benefits on the basis of continuous service. But I'm not sure it makes much sense in the situation that you have, where the benefits are earned because of separate periods of service.In that We'll hear argument this morning in Case -, United States versus Rahimi. General Prelogar. ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. ELIZABETH B. PRELOGAR ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER GENERAL PRELOGAR: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Guns and domestic abuse are a deadly combination. As this Court has said, all too often, the only difference between a battered woman and a dead woman is the presence of a gun. Armed abusers also pose grave danger to police officers responding to domestic violence calls and to the public at large, as Zackey Rahimi's own conduct shows. To address that acute threat, Congress and states and territories temporarily disarm individuals subject to domestic violence protective orders. Congress designed Section (g)() to target the most dangerous domestic abusers. It applies only if, after notice and a hearing, a court makes an express finding that We'll hear argument this morning in Case -, Harrington versus Purdue Pharma. Mr. Gannon. ORAL ARGUMENT OF CURTIS E. GANNON ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERCounsel, the argument that you just described, which was the same one you began with, which is you have a series of provisions focused on particular issues that arise in the context of the bankruptcy and then you have a general catchall talking about appropriate provisions not inconsistent, it seems to me that that's a fairly clear case for the application of what is We'll hear argument this morning in Case -, Muldrow versus the City of St. Louis. Mr. Wolfman. ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRIAN WOLFMAN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERWell --Go ahead.Well, that'sThis is very-- I -- and I'm sorry if I'm just repeating questions, but it's -- it's a very obviously significant thing and I found it extremely confusing looking at the briefs.

MOOPPAN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERSIs this a site-by-site determination or a message-by-message? In other words, let's say you have, you know, a site that's used every now and then for what you might characterize as official announcements, but the rest of the time it's, you know -- you know, my -- my child got a, you know, blue ribbon or something like that.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ADAM G. UNIKOWSKY ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERI -- I suppose logically standing is an antecedent question to mootness, right? You can't have something moot until you have a case.What -- I'm sorry to -- well, go ahead.Which --I was just going to say I'm as concerned as anybody about our workload, but -- (Laughter.) CHIEFWith --Yes.Thank you, counsel.

Thank We'll hear argument this morning in Case -, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau versus the Community Financial Services Association. General Prelogar. ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. ELIZABETH B. PRELOGAR ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS GENERAL PRELOGAR: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Fifth Circuit's decision in this case is the first time any court in our nation's history has held that Congress violated the Appropriations Clause by enacting a statute providing funding. This Court should uphold the CFPB's funding statute because it is firmly grounded in constitutional text and in historical practice dating back to the founding. The text of the Constitution shows that when the Framers wanted to limit Congress's appropriations authority, they did so expressly. And while the Framers restricted appropriations for the Army to two years, they We'll hear argument next in Case -, Great Lakes Insurance versus Raiders Retreat Realty. Mr. Wall. ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY B. WALL ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERYour -- your argument, I take it, is that there is an established federal maritime rule not simply on choice-of-law provisions but, I don't know, the Uberrimae Fidei doctrine, in other words, that even if your boat runs aground, you know, if you didn't have the fire extinguisher, you know, updated, you -- you lose. What if there weren't an established maritime policy on that specific doctrine?Well, I wonder if it --I was just going to say -- sorry to interrupt -- but, I mean, certainly, the argument can be made -- and I -- I think it's the argument of your friend on the other side -- that Wilburn Boat is expressly designed to do what you indicated that it doesn't matter, which is, if you have a very particular question like how the insurance policy should be interpreted, and there's no federal rule. There are general federal rules about choice-of-law, you know, but not the particular question there. We'll hear argument this morning in Case -, Culley versus Marshall. Mr. Dvoretzky. ORAL ARGUMENT OF SHAY DVORETZKY ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERSWell, you say courts rarely do that. Do we have any evidence about how long or how often courts in Alabama grant motions to expedite in this context?Thank you, counsel. I'd like to give you an opportunity to respond to the arguments raised I think primarily in the brief for the Solicitor General that requiring retention hearings at the early period that -- that you would will prejudice procedures under the civil forfeiture regime.Yeah, but the We'll hear argument next in Case -, Lindke versus Freed. Mr. Kedem. ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALLON KEDEM ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERWell, I mean, these -- on these pages, people -- people have both a job in the government and they have all sorts of other things, whether it's cats or children or whatever it is, and the problem it seems to me is we kind of have to disaggregate that, right, and say, well, you know, you have to have a governmental page and you have to have a private page and you can't mention the government on your private page or else it's going to become a government page. And as I understand it, you basically say, if you've got percent government, then we, the government, can basically say the whole thing, even if the rest of it is all about your children and -- and -- and the dogs, that's ours. And if we don't like little dogs, we can say you can't put pictures of little dogs on there. We'll hear argument this morning in Case -, Brown versus United States, and the consolidated case. Mr. Green. ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY T. GREEN ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER BROWNThank you.Yeah. Thank you, counsel. One of the things you emphasize in your -- not emphasize -- raise in your brief is the complexity that would accompany the government's approach. You know, as -- as you said, prosecutors, courts, probation officers, defense counsel would have to track down, cross-reference outdated federal. I -- I don't think that's that hard at all and -- and not that I could do it, but, you know, people who are -- (Laughter.) CHIEFWell, but I guess my point is they're defunct and they're decades old and they're readily available on current databases with a couple of key strokes?Thank you, We'll hear argument first this morning in Case -, Murray versus UBS Securities. Ms. Anand. ORAL ARGUMENT OF EASHA ANAND ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERJustice Alito.Thank you. Thank you, counsel. Normally, in the law in these types of cases, there is a distinction between liability and causation. In a car accident, you're speeding and you hit a car and injure the person or allegedly injure the person, the speeding is liability, right? Whether that has resulted in an injury, whether it's caused it is -- is a different question. Now your position merges those two, right? You don't separately look for liability and causation?Well, that's causation. And I think your friend on the other side draws the sharp distinction between liability and causation. And your position is that there is no distinction of that sort?Thank you. Justice Thomas? Justice Alito? Justice Sotomayor? Justice Kagan?Justice Gorsuch? Justice Kavanaugh?Justice Barrett?

ORAL ARGUMENT OF EUGENE SCALIA ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTSCounsel --Counsel --Counsel ---- both of your -- the counsel on the other side said that discrimination is simply treating people differently. I gather it's the essence of your position that that's not true?Well, intentional -- there must be more to that term if you think that those sentences from your adversaries are -- are wrong because you can intentionally treat people differently, but you think that's not necessarily discrimination?Thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas, anything further? Justice Sotomayor?Justice Kagan -- oh, I'm sorry.Justice Kagan?Justice Gorsuch? Justice Kavanaugh?

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERWell, it's theWell, but you -- you acknowledge, I think, that there may be -- the government benefit, even if it's properly characterized as a benefit, may be so significant that your analysis would not hold?Thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas, anything further? We'll hear argument first this morning in Case -, McElrath versus Georgia. Mr. Simpson. ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD A. SIMPSON ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERWell, as a general matter, do you agree that it's a matter of state law when jeopardy terminates? Because that's the -- that's the -- that's the basic question, right, whether the defendant is being put in jeopardy more than once. So you have to have the first jeopardy terminate before you can We will -- we'll hear argument this morning in Case -, Moore versus United States. Counsel. ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW M. GROSSMAN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERSWell, there certainly is realization here by the corporation, if not the taxpayers, right? It isn't a case like appreciation of property where nothing has happened. You know, you buy a property, you're holding it for years, you haven't sold it, nothing has happened. Here, something has happened, and income has gone to the corporation, isn't that right?Thank you, counsel.

GORE ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTSWell, I thought -- I thought he said that as far as geographic contiguity, that the -- the size of the different districts was a adequate proxy for that.Thank you, Mr. Gore. If I could move to a ,-foot perspective, how do you understand what we're supposed to do in evaluating clear error? I mean, we have just an appendices in this case that is like that, and let's say there are a hundred different factual determinations. If we think of them are wrong, do we reverse for clear error in that -- in that situation?Or -- or does it take more? We don't normally review -- other than in these cases, we don't normally review a record for factual findings, and I'm just wondering how you think we should do that.So we just give different degrees of the importance of particular facts and weigh those ---- in reviewing the entire record?Thank you, counsel.

FLETCHER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERCould -- could I ask you just a couple of examples and see where it falls under your definition? The federal government, in association with the states, built the interstate highway system, an enormous benefit to members of the public. Could the government decide that accidents interfere with what they were trying to accomplish in the highway system and create an agency to hear and adjudicate who's liable, responsible, and how much for accidents on the highway system? No court, no jury?Well, only -- only on a system where they gave the benefit which those people that have the accidents are taking advantage of.
